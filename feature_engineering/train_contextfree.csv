209,"In that lengthy process, a variety of commissioning editors, lawyers, backbench editors and the editor herself, Kath Viner, would normally insist on cuts to anything that could not be rigorously defended and corroborated.",0

237,It will soften opposition when the UK moves to arrest Assange on self-serving bail violation charges and extradites him to the US.,0
238,"The Guardian story will prepare public opinion for the moment when Ecuador’s rightwing government under President Lenin Moreno forces Assange out of the embassy, having already withdrawn most of his rights to use digital media.",0

253,"Instead, it amended the text, without acknowledging it had done so, to attribute the claims to unnamed, and uncheckable, “sources”.",0

1818,Kavanaugh “immediately submitted to an interview under penalty of felony for any knowingly false statements.,0
1819,"After Ford’s identity became public, Grassley’s staff “contacted all the individuals she said attended the 1982 party described in the Washington Post article,” he said.",0
1820,"“Every step of the way the Democratic side refused to participate in what should have been a bipartisan investigation,” Grassley said.",0
1821,"And then, sadly, the allegations were leaked to the press.”",0

1835,"She doesn’t know when or where the alleged incident took place, yet she is “one hundred percent” certain it was Kavanaugh who attacked her.",0
1836,Ford has a bad long-term memory and a bad short-term memory,1
1837,"When Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Ford “with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?” Ford replied, “one hundred percent.”",0

1847,She had many restrictions placed upon her and was only allowed to question Ford for minutes at a time before surrendering the floor to the next committee Democrat.,0
1848,She could do little else.,0
1849,It’s not that Mitchell did a bad job creating an inventory of the irregularities in the process and of the odd behavior of Ford and her lawyers.,0
1850,"Ford did well enough that during the break between her testimony and Kavanaugh’s, commentators on Fox News such as Brit Hume and Andrew Napolitano were openly musing about the nominee withdrawing, opinions that were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later.",0

2665,There are too many contrary instances of popes the Holy Spirit obviously would not have picked!” Bergoglio is undeniably one of them,1

2668,to dispel the pious fable,1
2669,"By 1100 what we now know as the College of Cardinals, embracing all the cardinals of different titles, had the exclusive right to elect a Pope, and the members of the College “have held it ever since.” (Eric John, The Popes, 181).",0
2670,"Only with the ascension of Pope Nicholas II in 1059 was it established that henceforth the cardinal-bishops would elect the Pope, with the other cardinals having the right to confirm or veto the nominee.",0
2671,"Indeed, even the Vatican’s own website states that Benedict was Pope from 1047-1048, the very year of his third ascension to the office from which he was finally driven by force.",0
2672,This was possible owing to the lack of any set canonical form for papal elections; a Pope could gain or regain the office by various machinations.,0

2693,"Believing, as he does, that his claims are correct, Viganò, in calling for Francis’ resignation, has done nothing more or less than exercise his right under canon law “to manifest to the sacred pastors [his] opinion on matters which pertain to the good of the Church and to make [his] opinion known to the rest of the Christian faithful…” 1983 CIC 212 § 3.",0

2697,"Of what was said above concerning resignation from Church office in general, what would not apply to a pope, of all office holders, if he, as alleged by Viganò, from the first months of his papacy knowingly protected and favored a cardinal who was [pick a disgusting verb]-ing seminarians?",0

3635,"The appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above, with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio, by Cardinal Parolin: “Reserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.” McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick’s abuses, as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28, 2016.",0
3636,"In fact, Father Hans Zollner, S.J., Vice-Rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University, President of the Centre for Child Protection, and Member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, recently told the newspaper La Stampa that “in most cases it is a question of homosexual abuse.”",0

3650,Once again the Pope did not show any reaction.,0
3651,pastoral carelessness,1
3652,"Not happy with the trap he had set for me on June 23, 2013, when he asked me about McCarrick, only a few months later, in the audience he granted me on October 10, 2013, Pope Francis set a second one for me, this time concerning a second of his protégés, Cardinal Donald Wuerl.",0
3653,"Indeed, I also knew how certain Cardinals such as Mahony, Levada and Wuerl, were closely linked to McCarrick; they had opposed the most recent appointments made by Pope Benedict, for important posts such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, Denver and San Francisco.",0
3654,"In his communication to the bishops, McCarrick had manipulated a letter of then-Cardinal Ratzinger who prohibited giving them Communion.",0
3655,"Also the Pope’s mention “not like the Archbishop of Philadelphia” could be traced to McCarrick, because there had been a strong disagreement between the two of them about the admission to Communion of pro-abortion politicians.",0
3656,"It was therefore clear that the words of reproach that Pope Francis had addressed to me on June 21, 2013 had been put into his mouth the day before by Cardinal McCarrick.",0
3657,"When he got back, Monsignor Lantheaume told me that in El Paso he had met Cardinal McCarrick who, taking him aside, told him almost the same words that the Pope had said to me in Rome: “the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing, they must be shepherds….” I was astounded!",0
3658,"When the new Bishop Mark Seitz took possession of the Diocese of El Paso on July 9, 2013, I sent the first Counsellor, Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, while I went to Dallas that same day for an international meeting on Bioethics.",0
3659,"Back in Washington everything became very clear to me, thanks also to a new event that occurred only a few days after my meeting with Pope Francis.",0
3660,"But then, what was the Pope’s purpose in asking me that question: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not.",0
3661,very grave,1
3662,"Immediately after, the Pope asked me in a deceitful way: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” I answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naiveté: “Holy Father, I don’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him.",0
3663,"And the Pope, in a very different, friendly, almost affectionate tone, said to me: “Yes, the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing like the Archbishop of Philadelphia, (the Pope did not give me the name of the Archbishop) they must be shepherds; and they must not be left-wing — and he added, raising both arms — and when I say left-wing I mean homosexual.” Of course, the logic of the correlation between being left-wing and being homosexual escaped me, but I added nothing else.",0
3664,"I began the conversation, asking the Pope what he intended to say to me with the words he had addressed to me when I greeted him the previous Friday.",0
3665,The Pope took me to the first floor in his apartment and said: “We have 40 minutes before the Angelus.”,0
3666,"At the end of Mass, while the Pope was greeting the few lay people present, Monsignor Fabian Pedacchio, his Argentine secretary, came to me and said: “The Pope told me to ask if you are free now!” Naturally, I replied that I was at the Pope’s disposal and that I thanked him for receiving me immediately.",0
3667,How could I have returned to Washington without having clarified what the Pope wanted of me?,0
3668,"On Sunday June 23, before the concelebration with the Pope, I asked Monsignor Ricca, who as the person in charge of the house helped us put on the vestments, if he could ask the Pope if he could receive me sometime in the following week.",0
3669,At the end of the audience the Pope announced: “Those of you who are still in Rome next Sunday are invited to concelebrate with me at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.” I naturally thought of staying on to clarify as soon as possible what the Pope intended to tell me.,0
3670,"I had in my hand a book in Portuguese that Cardinal O’Malley had sent me for the Pope a few days earlier, telling me “so he could go over his Portuguese before going to Rio for World Youth Day.” I handed it to him immediately, and so freed myself from that extremely disconcerting and embarrassing situation.",0
3671,aggressive,1
3672,"When it was my turn, I just had time to say to him, “I am the Nuncio to the United States.” He immediately assailed me with a tone of reproach, using these words: “The Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized!",0
3673,"In single file, I remember that I was among the last.",0
3674,"After his address, which was partly read and partly delivered off the cuff, the Pope wished to greet all the nuncios one by one.",0
3675,The next day the audience with Pope Francis took place.,0
3676,"Therefore I did not immediately grasp the meaning of the encrypted message that McCarrick had communicated to me, but that would become clear to me in the days immediately following.",0
3677,"Nor had I ever thought of the fact that he had participated in the preliminary meetings of the recent conclave, and of the role he had been able to have as a cardinal elector in the 2005 conclave.",0
3678,"At the time I knew nothing of his long friendship with Cardinal Bergoglio and of the important part he had played in his recent election, as McCarrick himself would later reveal in a lecture at Villanova University and in an interview with the National Catholic Reporter.",0
3679,"He immediately said to me, in a tone somewhere between ambiguous and triumphant: “The Pope received me yesterday, tomorrow I am going to China.”",0
3680,I greeted him respectfully as I had always done.,0
3681,"As soon as I entered the hall I met Cardinal McCarrick, who wore the red-trimmed cassock.",0
3682,"On the morning of Thursday, June 20, 2013, I went to the Domus Sanctae Marthae, to join my colleagues who were staying there.",0
3683,"It was my first meeting with the new Pope elected only three months prior, after the resignation of Pope Benedict.",0
3684,Of course I also came to Rome from Washington.,0

3693,"Given his tenure in Washington, Dallas and now Rome, I think no one can honestly believe him.",0
3694,"Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who was recently interviewed by the media, also said that he didn’t have the slightest idea about the abuses committed by McCarrick.",0
3695,They cannot deny it and they must be interrogated in order to reveal every circumstance and all responsibility regarding this matter.,0
3696,"Bishop Paul Bootkoski, emeritus of Metuchen, and Archbishop John Myers, emeritus of Newark, covered up the abuses committed by McCarrick in their respective dioceses and compensated two of his victims.",0
3697,"In doing so, he put other seminarians at risk.",0
3698,"Cardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope’s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C.",0
3699,But the Cardinal knew nothing about it!,0
3700,I subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years.,0

3705,Cardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion.,0
3706,shamelessly,1
3707,absolutely laughable,1
3708,"If, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained?",0
3709,"I immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it.",0
3710,"I also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick.",0
3711,"In any case, I myself brought up the subject with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn’t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it.",0
3712,"It is absolutely unthinkable that Nunzio Sambi, who was an extremely responsible person, loyal, direct and explicit in his way of being (a true son of Romagna) did not speak to him about it.",0
3713,"Obviously, the first to have been informed of the measures taken by Pope Benedict was McCarrick’s successor in Washington See, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, whose situation is now completely compromised by the recent revelations regarding his behavior as Bishop of Pittsburgh.",0

5184,It’s not enough now to go into seminary or a monastery with glowing eyes and a firm faith.,0
5185,What we have seen this week is making it clear that we can simply no longer sit back and “beg” bishops to maintain and defend the Faith.,0
5186,I think it’s only reasonable that those who also want to maintain the Faith should reach out to them and offer what shelter we can.,0
5187,"There are going to be nuns and monks without homes, as in the England of Henry VIII.",0
5188,The simple fact is that soon there are going to be “vagus” priests who have been thrown out of their ministry for maintaining the Faith.,0
5189,"And in a state of emergency, certain norms are naturally suspended.",0
5190,"Whatever you might think of Archbishop Lefebvre’s solution over the last few decades, it certainly seems inarguable that the “state of emergency” for which he was preparing has come at last.",0

5197,No items were lost during the evacuation.”,0
5198,"Twelve air-raid shelters were fitted out in the basements of the Museum complex and until the first evacuations were made in March 1942 there were 12,000 people housed there permanently, among them the Museum Director, celebrated Academician Iosif Orbeli.” “Hermitage staff both in Sverdlovsk and in Leningrad acted as museum attendants, continuing their scholarly activity and lecturing in hospitals, holding conferences, writing scholarly articles.",0
5199,"Equipped with first-aid kits, wearing helmets and gloves, the Museum air wardens cleared away heaps of broken bricks and the remains of charred flooring after each bomb hit the building; they helped dig out the living and the dead and bandage the wounded after raids in the surrounding area.",0
5200,"With only a skeleton staff left behind, it was difficult to protect the vast buildings and their sumptuous interiors against snow, wind and rain.",0

5204,Over a million precious works of art were sent on trains to be hidden in the Urals.,0
5205,"They took down, packed up and hid the art treasures, some of the greatest in the world.",0
5206,I am reminded of what the curators of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg did in the face of the advancing German army.,0
5207,"Our goal must be preserving the precious treasure, the Deposit of the Faith, the sacramental life, the great charisms and artifacts of the religious life.",0

5214,Those bishops want the property and they’ll get it.,0
5215,That monastery in Germany is lost.,0
5216,"Meanwhile, we must refocus our energy on the Faith itself, instead of the physical and even canonical structures that house it.",0
5217,Perhaps Catholic financial advisors could be encouraged to set up a programme to teach young men how to create a sound financial footing with investments.,0
5218,"I’m given to understand that some houses of the Congregation of the Oratory ask candidates to come with an independent income, which, given what we’re seeing elsewhere doesn’t sound like a bad idea.",0

5220,What’s your trade?,0
5221,"The next kid who says anything to me about wanting to enter the diocesan priesthood, I’m going to ask, “How sound is your investment portfolio?” The next candidate for religious life, I’ll ask, “Great!",0

5223,"Simply put, they’ve got to stop being materially dependent on the hierarchy.",0
5224,"Young men with ambitions for the priesthood are going to have to tuck away employability and an independent financial foundation, in the same way people used to tuck money away against a rainy day.",0
5225,I think this is the time we are going to have to start overcoming our class snobbery.,0
5226,"If you insist on having people with degrees, maybe a degree in agriculture would be a good fit for a big monastic foundation with a lot of land like, say, Clear Creek or that new Carmelite place in Nebraska.",0

5254,No one should be facing penury and permanent unemployment because he’s a faithful Catholic.,0
5255,There’s one big vulnerability we can guard against pretty easily.,0
5256,The other suggestion I have is for young men interested in the priesthood to fortify themselves not only spiritually but in the material sphere.,0

5266,"Catholics are going to have to get their heads out of the mindset that they are helpless petitioners, “begging” the hierarchy to maintain the Faith.",0
5267,I responded that this was going about things the wrong way.,0
5268,manifestly evil and apostate men,1
5269,"I started thinking about this recently when I received a note from a reader with a link to an online petition from Germany, addressed to the German bishops [!!!]",0
5270,"This would mean independent non-profit foundations that could build or buy church buildings, convents and even schools and provide salaries for priests and other staff.",0
5271,I am hearing lately from laymen who are starting to talk about setting up financial structures to ensure that the authentic Catholic life can be maintained through what is obviously soon to be a general collapse of the institution.,0
5272,"We could even perhaps buy a few convents so contemplative nuns could continue to pray in peace, without harassment from the evil men in Rome.”",0
5273,I responded: “And the money could be used to purchase properties to house faithful priests punished by their bishops for refusing the New Paradigm.,0
5274,"In response to the continued outrages of both “good” and bad bishops, Zmirak suggested establishing “an escrow fund in each scandal-plagued diocese, where laymen [can] deposit the funds they would have donated to [the] local church, until [a] new bishop [is] appointed.”",0
5275,"The other day the American conservative writer, John Zmirak, wrote a sound suggestion on Twitter that I think it’s time we all started taking seriously.",0
5276,"If we who still love the Church want priests to be faithful, and even to start denouncing the evil and corruption they see, we are going to have to help them create a modicum of independence and security in which to do it.",0
5277,We need to start working together with faithful priests – while there still are some – to help them create practical material alternatives.,0
5278,It’s not enough to simply demand that a priest continue in his ministry no matter what.,0
5279,"As we saw in Ireland this week, the Purge has started.",0
5280,The Old Paradigm is destroyed and going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else.,0
5281,So what do we do?,0
5282,we’ll destroy you,1
5283,"As one of them said to me, “The old arrangement was, ‘Remain faithful, do the work, and we will look after you.",0
5284,"I think a young man goes forward in great faith, spends ten to fifteen years studying philosophy and theology - fields that have almost no application in the workforce outside academia or the Church - with the honest, and frankly fair, expectation of a lifetime of employment and a safety net at the end.",0
5285,But I think honestly most priests are in this corner and they know it and so do their bishops.,0
5286,"Some of the men now coming forward with complaints against McCarrick, who left the priesthood over their experiences, have gone on to have normal, healthy working lives.",0
5287,Of course there are some who don’t fit this mould; there are a lot of second careers in the priesthood and plenty of people go into seminary after some years in the normal workforce and can go back to it at need.,0
5288,Many priests are getting older – many of them with health issues – and a man who has already given 20 or 30 years of his life to the Church is faced with a practical impossibility if he finds himself blacklisted.,0
5289,Well suck it up,1
5290,"I have been hearing from priests who are saying in effect, “We’re trapped in this situation and forced to remain silent because if we don’t we’ll not only be unable to function as priests, but we’ll be homeless and penniless.",0
5291,He will remain a pariah even among the so-called “good” bishops who live in terror of the immense power of the cabal… (see above re: McCarrick & President Bush/John Paul II.),0
5292,"And with the advent of Bergoglio in Rome, there are no more havens; as many of the former Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate have learned, the blackballing has gone global with this pontificate.",0
5293,"Moreover, because of the globalisation of the bishop-network, a man blackballed for his authentic Catholicity will be a pariah in every diocese in the world.",0
5294,"And these, remember, are men, often well on in years, whose only education and employment training has likely been academic degrees in philosophy and theology, and whose only professional contacts are ecclesiastical.",0
5295,"The bishop can, with the flick of a pen or a single phone call, render a priest homeless, penniless and jobless.",0
5296,"In short, not only can a bad bishop harry a man out of his ministry, he has complete control over the priest’s material life.",0

5302,I’ve had quite a few conversations with priests who are now asking how to deal with it.,0
5303,"For many priests, one might say all good priests, this is not a sustainable situation, to say the least.",0
5304,Nothing in a system like that is a greater threat to the corrupt than men who are not corrupt.,0
5305,"When I was covering the scandal in the early 2000s, I spoke to several, unconnected heterosexual men — priests, former priests, seminarians — who said that gay seminary rectors or diocesan officials encouraged them to take female sexual partners, so that they too would be complicit in sexual secret-keeping, and therefore no longer [be] a potential danger.",0
5306,"Later, as a priest, predators within the priesthood have that knowledge to hold over the heads of other gay priests, to keep them silent if they ever have the desire to blow whistles.",0
5307,"If they slip up even once, their failure will be noted, and shared… And they will be made to understand that their lapse is remembered.",0

5315,"Whether he now has to go live in obscurity in some beach house in the Caymans, it will remain true: McCarrick is the “New Church.”",0
5316,"The ‘conservatives’ are complicit, too.” In short, as it was during his days of glory, globe trotting on the dime of the State Department, hosting presidents for dinner and inviting John Paul II and Mother Theresa to tea, so it is now: McCarrick is the face of the New Paradigm.",0
5317,"As our friend Steve Skojec put it the other day, “We’ve got to stop pretending it’s just the progressive element in the Church.",0

8041,The structure of the Federation that we have had till now is thus no longer possible.,0
8042,We are left with the problem that in the communities there are no sisters who can or who want to be prioresses or council sisters.,0

8673,"So, how, exactly, is it to be determined – and by whom – that a group of nuns possess “the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism”?",0
8674,Or it could perhaps be described as a handle; a place where a person who wants to effect a particular outcome can grasp a piece of legislation to use it like an axe.,0

8685,Article 39 tells us some criteria for making foundations that “must be considered in their entirety and from an overall perspective.”,0
8686,The discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.,0
8687,"In discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious Assistant intervene to help the Superior of the founding monastery.",0
8688,"A single monastic community that decides to make a foundation, moreover, must be “helped” and guided by the federation:",0
8689,"39 of the present Instruction, can take place either by a single monastery or, as established by the Federal Assembly [9]",0
8690,"through the action of the Federation, as established by the Federal Assembly The foundation of a monastery of nuns, keeping in mind what is established in no.",0
8691,"Now, with the pope having forbidden bishops to exercise this ancient right, according to this document, the federations themselves can make foundations.",0
8692,"Throughout the history of the Church, it has been the prerogative of bishops to establish houses of contemplatives in their own dioceses.",0
8693,Who makes new foundations and why?,0
8694,"The President of the Federation, having heard the opinion of the Federal Council, chooses the most appropriate places to hold the specific formative courses for the formators and their collaborators, as well as those who are called to exercise the service of authority, establishing the duration of these courses in such a way that they are not detrimental to the needs of the contemplative life and of the community.",0
8695,"The formation of the formators and their collaborators is entrusted in part to the monasteries and in part to the Federation, therefore, the President of the Federation is called to strengthen formation at the federal level and to require the participation of those who exercise the service of formation; if this does not happen, she will refer the matter to the Holy See.",0
8696,"At the end of the visit, she will inform the Holy See about the real possibilities that the monastery has or does not have of guaranteeing initial formation.",0
8697,"The Federation President, in particular, watches over initial and ongoing formation in the monasteries to see if it is in conformity with the charism proper to the Institute, so that every community may be a beacon that illumines the journey of the men and women of our time.",0
8698,Federations in charge of formation,0
8699,"The economic fund [of the federation] is nourished by the free donations of the monasteries, by the donations of benefactors, and by revenues deriving from the alienation of the assets of suppressed monasteries, as established by the present Instruction.",0
8700,"In the event of the suppression of a totally extinct monastery, when there are no surviving nuns, unless otherwise provided by the Holy See, the destination of the suppressed monastery's assets, in compliance with canon and civil law, go to the respective higher juridical person, that is, to the Federation of monasteries or to another structure of communion among the monasteries equal to it or to the female monastic Congregation.",0
8701,"Article 73, on the disposition of the material assets of a monastery that has gone completely extinct:",0
8702,"Article 94 requires that once it is canonically erected the federation is to seek “legal recognition also in the civil sphere.” This, presumably, will bear upon legal disputes in civil courts over the property of suppressed monasteries.",0
8703,"Since the document provides several mechanisms by which a federation can move nuns out of a monastery, this could be one of those indelicate questions some superiors might want to keep in mind.",0
8704,"Given that we shall see below that the provisions for suppression of monasteries include vague and indefinable qualities like “vitality in living and transmitting the charism” and “dynamic fidelity” to the order’s charism, and that the goods of extinct monasteries will be assumed by the federation, one might be forgiven for asking if this creates an incentive to see to it that certain houses go extinct[8].",0
8705,Financial incentives,0
8706,The Federation considers the assets in its possession as necessary and useful means to achieve its goals.,0
8707,"The communication of goods in a Federation is implemented through contributions, gifts, loans that monasteries offer other monasteries that have financial difficulties, and for the common needs of the Federation.",0
8708,"To keep alive and strengthen the union of monasteries, implementing one of the aims of the Federation, a certain communication of goods is encouraged among the monasteries, coordinated by the Federal President.",0
8709,"The legitimately established Federation is a public juridic person in the Church and is therefore able to acquire, possess, administer, and alienate temporal, movable and immovable goods, which are ecclesiastical assets, in accordance with the universal and proper law.",0
8710,"It is the Federation that now has the power to monitor for compliance with the rules, to report non-compliance to the Holy See, to make new foundations and, apparently, to “encourage” individual monasteries to “communicate” their goods.",0
8711,"Federations will now have extremely broad powers both over money and property and, crucially, over formation of nuns.",0
8712,Broad powers,0
8713,"Confederation means a structure of connection among Federations of monasteries, erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, for the study of themes relative to contemplative life in relation to the same charism, to give unitary direction and a certain coordination to the activity of the individual Federations.",0
8714,"And finally, just in case one entire federation decides to turn back the clock, there will be an umbrella for the umbrellas; there will be watchers watching the watchers:",0
8715,"Imagine a house of traditional Carmelites attending regional Conference meetings – and attempting to keep up their Office schedule – with the balloons-and-guitars, break dancing Franciscans…What fun!",0
8716,"This will be of interest to Carmelite houses especially, since they tend to be generally more on the “conservative” end of things.",0

8733,"If the equation doesn’t come out in the patient’s favour, the “treatment” recommended for the patient’s “best interests” will include his demise, often procured by withdrawing nutrition and hydration and/or administering slowly lethal doses of sedatives.",0
8734,These guidelines are collated by professional Bioethicists applying their utilitarian criteria.,0

8742,It jogged a memory for me.,0
8743,"If the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery.",0
8744,Note the language used here:,0

8754,"She didn’t trust the heavily secularised field of psychology to help in determining a candidate’s suitability for religious life, so she didn’t require these tests of her monastery’s postulants.",0
8755,"She said she thought that the psychiatric testing, that in 2008 was still all the rage among the houses of her monastery’s federation, was excessive and not helpful.",0

8804,"The authors insist there is no contradiction between the two – except, of course, where there are contradictions – and that both Pius XII and Francis are keen to see nuns reaching the “aim of their specific vocation.” It describes Francis as promulgating this document “in the wake” of Pius XII[1].",0

8828,One aspect of Pope Francis’ character that seems little-explored by the Catholic and secular media alike is his apparent disdain for contemplative religious life – a facet of Catholic life that could be described as the most purely religious of all the Church’s undertakings.,0
8829,There is probably no other place where the differences between the two programmes - the Catholic programme of Christ and the Bergoglian/Kasperian programme - are more sharply contrasted.,0

10067,What kind of evidence?,0
10068,"Rather, it need only be shown by “a preponderance of evidence” that the person poses a risk of injury to self or others.",0
10069,"But even at that hearing, the standard of proof is far below the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used in criminal trials.",0
10070,"Within two weeks of the ex parte hearing, a hearing with the gun owner present must occur; the purpose is to put in place a long-term confiscation order.",0
10071,"In addition, the judge is forced to rush his decision and issue the confiscation order on the same day of the ex parte hearing.",0
10072,That’s even lower than the “probable cause” standard for obtaining a search warrant.,0
10073,absurdly low ,1

10075,"So a jilted former boyfriend or girlfriend, or even a roommate from years ago, could easily set in motion the disarming of a lawful gun owner.",0

10095,ANY ,1
10096,"This “I’m offended” or “his gun scares me” complaint is nothing but cover for little Nazis to try and deny another person their Natural, God-given liberty",1
10097,That the mere sight of a law-abiding citizen openly carrying a sidearm would make someone “afraid” is not sufficient reason to deny the citizen his constitutional right to keep and “bear” arms.,0
10098,SO WHAT,1
10099,"Sixthly, the man quoted in the news story who had complained about the armed fellow did so because he said he didn’t like the sight of the man carrying a firearm, as it made him “afraid.”",0
10100,"At some point, the American people will be forced to view these governmental attacks against our Second Amendment liberties as a declaration of war",1

10120,The report doesn’t even say the man was known for acting weirdly or strangely.,0
10121,Known for what?,0
10122,That means nothing.,0
10123,"Secondly, the man was “known” to nearby bars and restaurants near his place of residence.",0
10124,"Plus, he never removed the pistol from its holster or brandished it in any way.",0

10134,"“Law enforcement professionals said these specialized protection orders could be a common sense strategy to try and prevent mass shootings – such as what happened in Parkland, Florida.",0
10135,"“A few dozen erpos have been served and executed around the state, but Seattle police said they are the only agency so far to seize a gun because the owner refused to hand it over.",0
10136,"Because of the new law, police were then able to return with a warrant and force the man to surrender the firearm.”",0
10137,"“In this case, the man refused to comply.",0
10138,The volume of complaints convinced Seattle police to seek an extreme risk protection order – or ‘erpo’ – which allows law enforcement to legally remove guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.,0
10139,"“The man, who we are not naming, is also well known to the bars and restaurants below his unit along Second Ave.",0
10140,"“Mental illness is suspected, but that new law allowed police to legally disarm him.”",0

11557,"So, I have confidence.",0
11558,It is impossible to do all this without God’s assistance.,0
11559,And I am building a seminary in Switzerland.,0

11564,And we have confidence in God.,0
11565,"I think, however, they are very well prepared to deal with these difficulties and worries.",0
11566,"So, I ask you to pray for these seminarians because when they become priests they will have many worries and many difficulties.",0
11567,And it is a pity there are not 100 bishops opening good seminaries.,0
11568,They ask to become true priests.,0
11569,They refuse to become modernist.,0

11619,That is very bad.,0
11620,They are afraid of the truth.,0
11621,They do not express this truth clearly and perfectly.,0

11773,That is the school of our Faith.,0

11779,That is a new liturgy.,0

11787,hierarchical,1
11788,The true liturgy is hierarchical.,0
11789,Because we know the liturgy teaches us hierarchy.,0
11790,destroys the Church.,1
11791,That is very important.,0
11792,They know that.,0
11793,And they know that Jesus Christ is present - His real presence is on the altar - by the attitude of the priest.,0
11794,They can see what the priest does at the adoration of the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ.,0
11795,They can see what the priest does.,0

11809,"One of the principles of modern man, as they say now, “modern man,” is democracy.",0
11810,It is very bad.,0
11811,And the change in the liturgy is very important.,0
11812,That is impossible.,0
11813,We must tolerate - have tolerance for the error - but never give the same right to error and truth.,0
11814,We know that in many states (it is a pity) it is impossible [to recognize Catholicism as the state religion].,0
11815,Impossible,1
11816,We cannot say that.,0
11817,"We say in the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, “Tu solus Altissimus,” “Tu solus Dominus,” “You alone are the Highest,” “You alone are the Lord.” But practically, we would refuse this Kingdom of Jesus Christ if we said that Luther, Mohammed, Buddha and Jesus Christ are all the same.",0

11858,It is evident that all of the reforms came from the Council.,0

14350,That’s why they had shots fired from the front and placed Oswald in the rear.,1

14464,"So, why were they targeted for assassination?",0

14997,Too bad the mainstream press has never given that manual the consideration it deserves.,0
14998,Every American owes it to himself to read that manual.,0
14999,"In 1953, the CIA was in the process of developing a top-secret manual on assassinations, one that showed that the CIA was specializing not only in the art of assassination but also in the art of covering up its role in state-sponsored assassinations.",0

15001,But there has to be a reason why the CIA chose to keep this particular batch of records secret for more than 50 years.,0
15002,The CIA’s practice from the very beginning has been to not put any reference to a state-sponsored assassination into writing.,0
15003,And they don’t contain any reference to assassinating Kennedy.,0
15004,Of course not.,0
15005,Do the CIA’s long-secret records contain a video-taped confession?,0

15015,"It was being generously funded by the CIA and controlled by a secret CIA agent named George Joannides, which the CIA would intentionally keep secret from the Warren Commission in the 1960s, the House Select Committee in the 1970s, and the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.",0
15016,"What no one knew at the time, and what the CIA intentionally kept secret for decades, was that the DRE was a CIA front organization.",0
15017,"The first organization that came out with a press release advertising Oswald’s bona fides was the DRE, an anti-communist group in New Orleans with which Oswald had had contact.",0
15018,They had to make certain that Oswald was not on to them and had not discovered that he was being set up for a frame-up.,0
15019,"It would also explain why the CIA was closely monitoring Oswald’s movements prior to the assassination, something else that the CIA kept secret for decades.",0
15020,"In cases of covert state-sponsored assassinations, Latin American regimes were taught, a good strategy was to blame the assassination on a communist because then they could smear anyone who challenged the official story as a communist sympathizer.",0
15021,That would enable the CIA to blame the assassination on a communist,1
15022,purported communist,1
15023,"In that case, it would be imperative that the CIA and the military keep as tight a lid on their records as possible to ensure that investigators or investigative reporters would have a difficult time piercing through to the circumstantial evidence that establishes the frame-up.",0

15030,"Such being the case, the mainstream media, deferring to the CIA, automatically concludes that its wish to continue keeping secret has to be based on “national security” grounds rather than an attempt by the CIA to continue its cover-up of its assassination of the president.",0

15566,The same applies to statements of Pope Francis and Cardinal Schoenborn mentioned by Ferrara.,0
15567,In fact the statement of the Argentine bishops only speaks of the possibility of “access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist.” This could reasonably be interpreted as going to confession before receiving Holy Communion.,0

15580,Thank you for your response.,0
15581,Robert Fastiggi to Chris Ferrara • 2 hours ago,0
15582,A moral catastrophe is self-evidently underway and it is not possible honestly to deny its cause.,0
15583,It is a great disservice to the Church to maintain the pretense that there is nothing problematical about AL.,0
15584,"No amount of verbal artifice can conceal what is happening in the Church thanks to AL: Public adulterers are being admitted to Holy Communion without an amendment of life and the bimillenial discipline of the Church---which John Paul insisted involves a moral norm, not a mere ecclesiastical law, to which everyone is bound in conscience “without exception”---is being overthrown in place after place.",0
15585,"Thus, Francis thanked the Maltese bishops for their AL guidelines, which literally mandate admission to the sacraments of divorced and “remarried” people who believe themselves to be “at peace with God.” And, as he told the bishops of Buenos Aires in writing, “there is no other interpretation.”",0
15586,"As my article shows, Francis has made it quite clear that he approves of admitting to the sacraments divorced and “remarried” people who will continue to live as if they were married, including sexual relations, while “discerning” their situation, this “discernment” being a mere fig leaf to conceal the proposed toleration of public adultery in the Church.",0
15587,"At any rate, the “brother and sister” approach to the situation, which is that of Familiaris consortio 84, is certainly not the one advocated by Francis.",0
15588,"Such a couple could always be absolved and receive Holy Communion under the Church’s constant practice, albeit privately to avoid scandal.",0
15589,But that would be ceasing to commit the sin of adultery altogether as it would involve abandoning the pretense that they are married along with the illicit sexual relation itself.,0
15590,Just how nonsensical is demonstrated by Dr. Fastiggi’s claim that by “a move away from sin” in the case of a divorced and “remarried” couple Francis means their agreement to live in continence as brother and sister for the sake of children.,0
15591,The notion is nonsensical.,0
15592,No example is provided in AL because none can be.,0
15593,What constitutes a “move away” from sin if not ceasing to commit the sin?,0
15594,"With all due respect to Dr. Fastiggi, his argument and that of Buttiglione, that a “move away from sin” is what is pleasing to God, even if the moral norm is not adhered to, is sophistical.",1
15595,"Rather, as I show in my article, it only intensifies them.",0
15596,I certainly do not agree that the Latin text eliminates the grave problems with Amoris Laetitia.,0
15597,I certainly agree that the Latin text is the normative text even if it comes later.,0
15598,Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 9 hours ago,0
15599,It is sad that this beautiful and compassionate message of AL 303 has been so completely misunderstood by scholars who have failed to grasp its true meaning.,0
15600,This is the law of gradualness not the gradualness of the law.,0
15601,"God, however, is happy when people in such situations discern in conscience that He is asking them to make a choice that moves in the right direction—even if they still need to progress further toward a more complete fulfillment of His will.",0
15602,God is not happy with situations that are objectively at variance with the command of the Gospel.,0
15603,This is what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303.,0
15604,"No, he is pleased that his son gives symptoms of improvement and healing.”",0
15605,Is he happy about the fact that the child is sick?,0
15606,The father is happy.,0
15607,He still has fever but has stopped vomiting; the child manages to keep in his stomach what he eats and has started a therapy that seems to work.,0
15608,"In a recent interview (http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., the Italian philosopher, Rocco Buttiglione, provides this example for AL 303: “Imagine a father who has a sick son and the child improves.",0
15609,"Pope Francis explains this again in AL 305 when he says “a small step, in the midst of great human limitations, can be more pleasing to God than a life which appears outwardly in order",1
15610,AL 303 teaches that conscience will come to recognize that God is asking for a step in the right direction away from sin.,0
15611,It’s really just the opposite.,0
15612,Our example was an attempt to show that Professors Brugger and Seifert are wrong to believe AL 303 implies that God is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state.,0
15613,We chose this example deliberately to demonstrate that “the generous response” could be the ending of a particular sin.,0
15614,"In our Sept. 26 article in La Stampa, Dr. Goldstein and I provided a hypothetical example of a couple in a purely civil “marriage” recognizing that God is calling them to live in continence.",0
15615,"Moreover, he knows that concrete cases vary widely.",0
15616,What might be this “generous response?” Pope Francis does not give an example in AL 303 because he’s speaking in general terms of the dynamics of conscience.,0
15617,The “generous response” is not the situation that is at variance with the command of the Gospel but an offering that God is asking amid the mass of impediments even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model.,0
15618,Prof. Brugger fails to see that AL 303 clearly distinguishes between a conscience’s recognition that “a given situation is objectively at variance with the general mandate of the Gospel” and this same conscience’s subsequent recognition of a “generous response owed to God in the present circumstances.” The subject “conscience” might be the same but the object is different.,0
15619,"In his April 22, 2016 article in Catholic World Report, Brugger writes that AL 303 suggests that “God can be ‘asking’ someone to live in a life-state in which they are objectively violating grave matter.” Then in a Sept. 28 ‘17 LifeSiteNews article, he states that “the generous response” owed to God is “a certain state that is objectively at variance with the universal command of the Gospel.” Now Prof. Brugger argues that, because the subject remains “this conscience” in AL 303, this proves that the “generous offering owed to God” is the recognition that one is living “contrary to “the universal command of the Gospel.”",0

16003,"Meanwhile, as Fastiggi and Goldstein labor to convince us that nothing is amiss with AL, Pope Bergoglio is sending clear signals of concern about the rising opposition among the faithful to his master plan to subvert the Church according to his false notion of mercy.",0
16004,"A similar judgment might well befall this Pope, but it is not for us to level it.",0
16005,And yet Honorius I is listed in the canon of the Popes and is not considered to have fallen from office on account of heresy.,0
16006,"Honorius did so by means of private correspondence with the author of the heresy, endorsing the heresy without ever formally proclaiming it as doctrine.",0
16007,"In so acting, he is very much in the mold of Honorius I, who was posthumously anathematized by an ecumenical council (the Third Council of Constantinople) and by his own successor (Leo II) for aiding and abetting the spread of the Monothelite heresy (no human but only a divine will in Christ).",0
16008,"But Bergoglio wants the effects of heresy—undermining Holy Matrimony, Confession and Holy Communion, whose integrity is affirmed verbally—without the guilt of an explicit promulgation.",0
16009,"In a sense, what Bergoglio is doing is worse than explicit heresy",1
16010,As Shaw observes of AL: “What we [the signers of the Correctio] are saying is that it has become clear that orthodoxy is not what Pope Francis wants us to find there.”,0
16011,for “certain” public adulterers,1
16012,"But Francis, as any reasonable observer can see, has no intention of offering any such correction.",0
16013,"Moreover, any Pope who promulgates a document that can be read as orthodox only by a forced interpretation imposed by certain readers—while others disagree—has by that very fact inflicted grave harm upon on the Church, which he alone has the duty to correct.",0
16014,But it is not our responsibility to bend a Pope’s statements into conformity with the Faith.,0
16015,Shaw maintains that AL can be “bent into some kind of orthodoxy.” Perhaps.,0
16016,See the piece by Joseph Shaw in this regard.,0
16017,"This Pope’s plan of promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document whose heterodox interpretation and application he would later approve with a series of sub-magisterial winks and nods, both oral and written, is the reason I signed onto the Correctio Filialis.",0
16018,"If, as a result of the process of discernment, undertaken with “humility, discretion and love for the Church and her teaching, in a sincere search for God’s will and a desire to make a more perfect response to it” (AL 300), a separated or divorced person who is living in a new relationship manages, with an informed and enlightened conscience, to acknowledge and believe that he or she are at peace with God, he or she cannot be precluded from participating in the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (see AL, notes 336 and 351).",0
16019,"Moreover, the Maltese bishops' “guidelines” for implementing AL, published in L’Osservatore Romano—for which Bergoglio thanked them—declare thus:",0
16020,"But the Fastiggi-Goldstein interpretation is precisely the contrary of the interpretation Francis has assiduously promoted and which Fastiggi and Goldstein just as assiduously ignore: i.e., that people in “second marriages” do not have to live in continence, but rather—in “certain cases”—may continue their adulterous relations while receiving absolution and Holy Communion during a “process of discernment.” As we know, in his letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires, published on the Vatican website (in response to a query he himself may have solicited), Bergoglio informed them “there is no other interpretation.”",0
16021,Our dynamic translators,1
16022,"But wait, there’s more",1
16023,has been the mantra of the neo-Catholic establishment for nearly half a century of ecclesial auto-demolition.,0
16024,No problem here!,0
16025,"And Fastiggi and Goldstein are busily helping it along, changing red signals to green.",0
16026,But such embarrassing truths need not impede the Bergoglian Mercy Train as it barrels toward a train wreck at the end of the line.,1
16027,"Then again, the Pharisees are precisely the ones Our Lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law.",0
16028,Are you perfect?,0
16029,"Indeed, their “proposed alternate translation” reduces the avoidance of adulterous relations in “second marriages” to the “perfect objective model.” Now, how could anyone but a Pharisee expect perfection from people living in adultery?",0
16030,It seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice that their linguistic tinkering produces no real change in meaning but only an intensification of its perniciousness.,0
16031,"According to their proposed “alternate translation” into English, What the Pope Really Means® is that objectively immoral behavior one feels unable to correct due to one’s “limits” is “the offering that God himself is asking amid the mass of impediments, although it may not yet be the perfect objective model.” Which is what the official English translation already says but with fewer words.",0
16032,all the tumult triggered by AL is just a misunderstanding caused by uninformed people who haven’t consulted the Latin text—,1
16033,"Thus, continence cannot realistically be expected, at least “for now” (AL 303), of the average Joe or Jane with an “ex” who has “remarried” and is now mired in the “concrete complexity one’s limits.”",0
16034,For if moral behavior is now to be viewed as merely “exemplary” rather than divinely mandated by the natural law that binds all men—including Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery—then basic morality becomes a kind of heroic virtue.,0
16035,Here too Fastiggi and Goldsetein only worsen the problem they try to explain away.,0
16036,"Likewise, the definition of the English word “exemplar” is simply: “an ideal model.”",0
16037,"A pattern or model to follow is an ideal, as a standard Latin dictionary confirms with its definition of exemplar: “(1) copy/reproduction, (2) model, pattern, example, original, ideal.",0
16038,Break.,0

16040,Me.,0
16041,Give.,0
16042,all those ignorant critics of AL,1
16043,"Not so, Fastiggi and Goldstein contend.",0
16044,"What about the English locution “while yet not fully the objective ideal,” which seems to reduce the negative precepts of the natural law to mere ideals?",0
16045,Fastiggi and Goldstein have managed to make the problem even worse in their attempt to explain it away.,0
16046,our intrepid presenters,1
16047,And that is exactly the nonsense Fastiggi and Goldstein expect us to swallow,1
16048,It would seem the Latin version has graver implications than the English because it suggests that falling short of what the moral law requires is an oblation pleasing to God if one’s “limits” make obedience to the moral law difficult.,0
16049,But just a moment: how can objectively immoral behavior ever be characterized as an “offering” to God?,0
16050,Big difference.,0
16051,"So, What the Pope Really Means® is: “what for now is the most generous offering which can be given to God.” So, it’s an offering to God, not a response to God.",0
16052,"Well, according to Fastiggi and Goldstein, while the English translation reads: “what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God,” the Latin employs the word oblationem, which means offering.",0
16053,"Yes, and so what?",0
16054,"Haec autem conscientia agnoscere potest non modo statum quendam ab universali Evangelii mandato obiective dissidere; etiam sincere honesteque agnoscere poteste quod sit liberale responsum in praesenti Deo reddendum atque eadem conscientia firma quadam morali certitudine intellegere illam esse oblationem quam ipse Deus requirit inter rerum impedientium congeriem, quamvis perfectum nondum sit obiectivum exemplar.",0

16058,Dawn Goldstein,0
16059,Dr. Robert Fastiggi and Dr.,0

16061,"Dawn Eden Goldstein, S.T.D., professor of Dogmatic Theology at Holy Apostles College and Seminary.",0
16062,"But it’s all a misunderstanding, say Dr. Robert Fastiggi, professor of Systematic Theology at Sacred Heart Major Seminary, and Dr.",0
16063,"In other words, the conscience can “inform” a sinner that his continued sinning is not only acceptable to God but is even what God is asking “for now,” given one’s particular “limits.” This outrageous proposition, a form of situation ethics that strikes at the very foundation of Catholic moral teaching, has justly provoked a storm of criticism from lay and clerical defenders of the authentic Magisterium.",0
16064,"It can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one’s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal.",0
16065,Yet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel.,0
