"Next plague outbreak in Madagascar could be 'stronger': WHO
",-1
"An outbreak of both bubonic plague, which is spread by infected rats via flea bites, and pneumonic plague, spread person to person, has killed more than 200 people in the Indian Ocean island nation since August.
",-1
"Madagascar has suffered bubonic plague outbreaks almost every year since 1980, often caused by rats fleeing forest fires.
",-1
"The disease tends to make a comeback each hot rainy season, from September to April.
",-1
"On average, between 300 and 600 infections are recorded every year among a population approaching 25 million people, according to a UN estimate.
",-1
"Cases sprang up far earlier than usual and, instead of being confined to the countryside, the disease infiltrated towns.
",-1
"The authorities recorded more than 2 000 cases, and Tedros said Wednesday the death toll stood at 207.
",-1
"The larger-than-usual outbreak had helped spread the bacteria that causes the plague more widely.
",-1
"Complicating vector control is the fact that the fleas that carry the Yersinia pestis bacteria that causes the plague have proven to be widely resistant to chemicals and insecticides.
",-1
"""That's a dangerous combination,"" Tedros said.

"US bloggers banned from entering UK
",-1
"Two prominent US bloggers have been banned from entering the UK, the Home Office has said.
",-1
"Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer co-founded anti-Muslim group Stop Islamization of America.
",-1
"They were due to speak at an English Defence League march in Woolwich, where Drummer Lee Rigby was killed.
",-1
"A government spokesman said individuals whose presence ""is not conducive to the public good"" could be excluded by the home secretary.
",-1
"'Right decision'
",-1
"They were due to attend a march planned by the far-right EDL to mark Armed Forces Day on 29 June, ending in Woolwich, south east London, where soldier Drummer Rigby was murdered last month.
",-1
"Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, who had called for the bloggers to be banned from the UK, said: ""I welcome the home secretary's ban on Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer from entering the country.
",-1
"This is the right decision.
",-1
"The UK should never become a stage for inflammatory speakers who promote hate.""
",-1
"EDL leader Tommy Robinson, meanwhile, criticised the decision and said Ms Geller and Mr Spencer were coming to the UK to lay flowers at the place where Drummer Rigby died.
",-1
"It just shows what sort of a two-tier system we have here.""
",-1
"'Foster hatred'
",-1
"Anti-fascism campaigners Hope Not Hate had campaigned for the pair to not be allowed into the UK.
",-1
"A researcher with the organisation, Matthew Collins, said it was ""delighted"" with the decision.
",-1
"""These two are among some of the most extreme anti-Muslim activists in the world.
",-1
"They've nothing to contribute to life in this country.
",-1
"""They're not here to contribute to good community relations.
",-1
"They only wanted to come here and help the EDL stir up more trouble.
",-1
"Britain doesn't need more hate even just for a few days.""
",-1
"Mr Spencer put up a copy of what appears to be the exclusion decision from the Home Office on the Jihad Watch website, while Ms Geller posted a copy of her letter on her website, Atlas Shrugs.
",-1
"The letters, both dated Tuesday, claim that both activists have fallen within the scope of a list of unacceptable behaviours by making statements which may ""foster hatred"" and lead to ""inter-community violence"" in the UK.
",-1
"Both letters gave examples of anti-Muslim views stated by both and went on to say that should they be allowed to enter the UK the home secretary believes they would ""continue to espouse such views"".

"Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here's the story behind her killing
",-1
"Garcia Zarate, a 45-year-old Mexican national who was homeless and living in the US illegally when he fired the shot that killed Steinle, was acquitted by a jury on murder and manslaughter charges.
",-1
"The jury convicted him of the lesser charge of being a felon in possession of a gun, which carries a maximum sentence of three years in state prison.
",-1
"Steinle, 32, was fatally shot while she walked along Pier 14 of the San Francisco Bay with her father in July 2015.
",-1
"The bullet that pierced her back had ricocheted off the concrete ground after it was fired by Garcia Zarate from a handgun belonging to a federal ranger that had been stolen four days earlier.
",-1
"Garcia Zarate's defense attorneys argued that the shooting was an accident — they said he found the gun wrapped in a T-shirt or cloth under a pier bench and unintentionally discharged it.
",-1
"Gonzalez told the jury, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, that Garcia Zarate had never handled a firearm before, was frightened by the noise of the gunshot, then flung the weapon into the bay where it was later found by a diver.
",-1
"Prosecutors, however, alleged that Garcia Zarate brought the weapon to the pier deliberately to do harm, and intentionally aimed and shot Steinle after firmly pulling the trigger.
",-1
"They said Garcia Zarate then threw the weapon into the bay and fled the scene.
",-1
"Beyond the shooting itself, perhaps the most controversial aspect of Garcia Zarate's case involves his previous criminal activity and history of deportations, and how San Francisco and federal authorities handled his custody before he ever picked up the gun and shot Steinle.
",-1
"At the time of Steinle's death, Garcia Zarate had been convicted of nonviolent drug crimes and deported five times since the early 1990s.
",-1
"He faced a sixth deportation in 2015, and was in Justice Department (DOJ) custody that March after serving 46 months in prison for a felony re-entry into the US, but instead of transferring him into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deportation, the department transferred him to the San Francisco County Jail for prosecution of a 1995 marijuana charge.
",-1
"San Francisco prosecutors, who had long ago deprioritized marijuana charges, dismissed the decades-old charge and released Garcia Zarate on April 15, 2015.
",-1
"As a result of the case, both the DOJ and the city of San Francisco have changed several policies.
",-1
"The DOJ announced in 2016 it would no longer release potentially deportable detainees to local jails without first allowing ICE to take custody.
",-1
"San Francisco, meanwhile, has adjusted its policy to notify ICE if they are releasing suspected undocumented immigrants who face charges of serious or violent felonies.
",-1
"But ICE has faced criticism of its own over not seeking a judicial warrant to legally obtain custody of Garcia Zarate when it discovered he had been transferred into San Francisco's custody.
",-1
"The agency has argued that obtaining judicial warrants are unnecessary and would place too much burden on ICE officials and federal courts.
",-1
"Though the agency did issue a request to the city to detain Garcia Zarate until ICE officials could pick him up, their detainer requests are not signed by a judge and are therefore not legally binding.
",-1
"San Francisco's policy is to ignore such requests if they are not accompanied by judge-signed warrants, and the city has cited federal court cases concluding that such detentions violate inmates' Fourth Amendment rights.
",-1
"President Donald Trump immediately seized on the verdict on Thursday as evidence of the perils of ""Illegal Immigration.""
",-1
"Trump frequently villainized Garcia Zarate and cited Steinle's death during his presidential campaign, using the case to bolster his argument for a border wall and aid his crusade against ""sanctuary cities.""
",-1
"Early on Friday, Trump also falsely claimed on Twitter that Garcia Zarate had previously committed violent crimes and had illegally entered the US six times due to lax border security under the Obama administration.
",-1
"Trump tweeted.
",-1
"In fact, Garcia Zarate had never been convicted of a violent crime before Steinle's shooting — his previous convictions were for nonviolent drug crimes and illegal entry.
",-1
"Lax border security, too, does not appear to be a factor since Garcia Zarate was caught by border patrol agents each time he entered the country under the Obama administration.
",-1
"In contrast, Steinle's family has expressed nuanced views on immigration and ""sanctuary"" policies.
",-1
"They have both condemned Trump for ""sensationalizing"" Steinle's death to advance anti-immigration policies, and expressed frustration with San Francisco officials, who they believe went too far in refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

"U.S. judge frees Indonesian immigrant held by Trump order
",-1
"A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered the release of an illegal immigrant who is among 47 Indonesians in New Hampshire challenging the Trump administration’s order to deport them.
",-1
"SPONSORED
",-1
"Rombot, part of a wave of Indonesian Christians who fled their country following deadly riots in 1998, learned of the policy change when he appeared for an Aug. 1 check-in with ICE and was arrested.
",-1
"“He walks out of the courthouse right now,” Chief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris said after concluding that Rombot’s detention violated his rights.
",-1
"He walked out of the U.S. District Court in Boston in his blue jail scrubs, without a chance to change into street clothes.
",-1
"Rombot’s lawyers said he was arrested despite a 2015 letter from ICE saying he would have a chance to prepare for an “orderly” departure.
",-1
"The judge cited that letter during Wednesday’s hearing in holding that Rombot’s detention despite ICE’s previous guidance violated his due process rights under the U.S. Constitution.
",-1
"“This is what intent was, that he would be given the opportunity to leave under his own steam and not under shackles,” she said.
",-1
"Outside the courtroom, Rombot said: “I just want to say thank you to my attorney, my pastor and all of my friends.”
",-1
"The U.S. Attorney’s office is considering an appeal, a spokeswoman said.
",-1
"ICE officials said the arrangement had always been a temporary one and that the agency always had discretion to deport the people covered by the arrangement.
",-1
"The Indonesians are part of an ethnic community of about 2,000 people clustered around the city of Dover in New Hampshire’s seacoast region.
",-1
"Members of the group and advocates say they fear they could face discrimination or violence if forced to return to the world’s largest Muslim-majority country.
",-1
"Their cause has drawn the support of Republican Governor Chris Sununu and New Hampshire’s all-Democratic congressional delegation, including U.S.
",-1
"Senator Jeanne Shaheen.
",-1
"Saris previously ordered a stay to the deportations.
",-1
"She is currently weighing whether she can order a longer delay to give the affected people time to renew their efforts to gain legal status.

"Here are all the sexual misconduct accusations against Sen. Al Franken
",-1
"Sen. Al Franken announced his resignationon the Senate floor Thursday morning, as Democratic calls for his resignation mount following the latest sexual misconduct accusations against him.
",-1
"About 30 Senate Democrats, starting with women, have urged the Minnesota Democrat to step down.
",-1
"Franken on Thursday denied most of the allegations, which started to surface last month.
",-1
"Here are the eight accusations he faces:
",-1
"Leeann Tweeden, a radio news anchor, says Franken groped and forcibly kissed her during a USO tour in 2006, before the former comedian was a senator.
",-1
"A photo also surfaced showing Franken looking at a camera while pretending to grab Tweeden's breasts as she was sleeping while clothed.
",-1
"The senator apologized for the photo but said he remembered the skit incident differently.
",-1
"Lindsay Menz says Franken grabbed her buttocks when the pair posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010.
",-1
"Franken later said he did not remember taking the picture but ""felt badly"" that Menz felt disrespected.
",-1
"Two other unidentified women told HuffPost that Franken grabbed their buttocks at separate events in 2007 and 2008.
",-1
"One of the women says Franken suggested that he and she should go to the bathroom together.
",-1
"Franken said he did not remember the events and denied asking anyone to visit the bathroom with him.
",-1
"Stephanie Kemplin, an Army veteran, says Franken put his hand on her breast during a USO tour in 2003.
",-1
"The senator has not appeared to respond specifically to the allegation.
",-1
"An unnamed former Democratic congressional aide told Politico that the senator tried to forcibly kiss her after he taped a radio show in 2006.
",-1
"She says she avoided the kiss, then heard Franken say ""it's my right as an entertainer.""
",-1
"Franken called the allegation ""categorically not true.""
",-1
"The senator has not specifically responded to that allegation.

"Trump formally nominates Gina Haspel to be next CIA director
",-1
"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump formally notified Congress on Tuesday that deputy CIA director Gina Haspel is his pick to lead the agency.
",-1
"Trump tweeted last month that he had selected Haspel to replace Mike Pompeo, who is being considered to be secretary of state.
",-1
"But the president had not sent the formal paperwork to Capitol Hill.
",-1
"Logistical issues, including an FBI background check that took longer than expected, was to blame, according to a U.S. official, who was not authorized to discuss the issue and spoke only on condition of anonymity.
",-1
"Some lawmakers and human rights groups oppose Haspel’s nomination because of her role in the CIA’s detention and harsh interrogation of terror suspects after 9/11.
",-1
"The Senate intelligence committee is expected to have a confirmation hearing for Haspel in coming weeks, followed by a vote in the full Senate.

"Dallas Police Dept.
",-1
"fires officer who killed Botham Jean in his apartment
",-1
"The Dallas Police Department fired Officer Amber Guyger on Monday, two weeks after she was charged in the fatal shooting of her neighbor.
",-1
"This contradicted the police chief’s recent statements that she was unable to discipline the officer while a criminal investigation proceeded.
",-1
"Guyger allegedly walked into the apartment of the neighbor, Botham Jean, and fatally shot him Sept 6.
",-1
"When she was arrested three days later on manslaughter charges, Guyger said she confused Jean’s home for her own, confused Jean for an intruder, and shot him when he refused her commands, according to court documents.
",-1
"The victim’s family has disputed her account and said she had knocked on Jean’s door before killing him.
",-1
"The incident — one of more than 700 police killings counted by The Washington Post this year — sparked criticism against the police department, which waited days to arrest Guyger, then went weeks without disciplining her even though she was placed on leave.
",-1
"“The delay raised questions about why investigators held off on arresting the officer and about whether law enforcement authorities were showing deferential treatment for one of their own,” Kristine Phillips and Deanna Paul wrote for The Post.
",-1
"After repeated protests, Police Chief U. Reneé Hall gave contradictory explanations last week for why she could not fire the officer.
",-1
"She told a town hall that “local, state and federal laws prohibit me from taking action,” according to ABC affiliate WFAA.
",-1
"Two days later, the Dallas Morning News reported that police could fire Guyger but did not plan to review her employment until a criminal investigation wrapped up — probably months away.
",-1
"In a statement, Hall said that any disciplinary investigation would risk compromising the criminal case.
",-1
"“That is not a risk I am willing to take,” she said.
",-1
"Police did not explain what changed by Monday, when the department announced that an internal-affairs investigation had been launched and already “concluded” that Guyger’s arrest was a fireable offense.
",-1
"The officer, who was hired in late 2013, was terminated during a hearing Monday morning “for her actions.”
",-1
"The statement notes that Guyger can appeal her firing.
",-1
"Police did not comment on whether Hall is still worried that the termination might affect the criminal investigation.
",-1
"As Paul wrote for The Post, the more significant legal questions are whether Guyger is prosecuted as a police officer or civilian and whether a jury decides she acted reasonably in using deadly force.
",-1
"The president is doubling down on an increasingly risky candidate.
",-1
"To begin with, Trump has outsourced his judicial nominations to outside, party-aligned groups, the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society.
",-1
"That included an unusually central role for the Federalist Society’s Leonard Leo.
",-1
"That wasn’t entirely a Trump mistake.
",-1
"The party was worried that Trump might turn out not to be a conservative; to reassure them, he publicly committed to their top goal.
",-1
"In some ways, that’s successful coalition-building, and what he’s done in office is just keeping his promises on judges.
",-1
"Still, it’s one thing to form an alliance with conservatives; it’s another to turn the whole process over to them.
",-1
"We don’t know to what extent Kavanaugh was Trump’s choice and to what extent he was manipulated into choosing him.
",-1
"1
",-1
"Either way, Kavanaugh was a poor choice from the point of view of good presidenting.
",-1
"The judge was certain to be a highly controversial selection from the start.
",-1
"After all, he had been a highly controversial selection for his current circuit court seat, eventually getting confirmed with only four Democratic votes after a long delay.
",-1
"Kavanaugh is a longtime Republican operative, a hard-liner during both the Vince Foster and Monica Lewinsky investigations.
",-1
"Nominating him, rather than a conservative with similar views but a different background, was bound to stir up trouble.
",-1
"It was also true, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly warned, that normal disclosure of Kavanaugh’s record, especially his service during the George W. Bush administration, was going to delay confirmation even more.
",-1
"Senate Republicans dealt with that problem by deciding to not bother with any Kavanaugh documents that couldn’t be produced rapidly, which further riled up the Democrats and gave that party some good talking points.
",-1
"2
",-1
"Sometimes it’s worth taking risks.
",-1
"Presidents who shy away from anything that’s not a sure thing can fail to exploit opportunities.
",-1
"It’s just very hard to see any upside for Trump in choosing Kavanaugh instead of a safer, but still very conservative, other option.
",-1
"3
",-1
"When serious charges of sexual misconduct were raised against Kavanaugh, Trump decided to stick with him instead of moving on to another candidate.
",-1
"Losing a high-profile fight is always going to hurt a president, which is why they should take care to avoid high-risk, low-reward conflicts.
",-1
"But there’s an art to minimizing damage.
",-1
"Whether that matters in terms of public opinion for Trump is unclear, but it certainly isn’t good for any Republican senators caught up in the middle, along with any other candidates who have had to weigh in only to find the facts as they knew them constantly changing.
",-1
"If the nomination had been pulled right after Christine Blasey Ford made her initial assertions about Kavanaugh, the public might have concluded that it wasn’t Trump’s fault that a previously unaired accusation came to light.
",-1
"Meanwhile, Trump’s behavior has been as erratic as ever.
",-1
"He sometimes praises Kavanaugh, but also let it be known that he thought the nominee had performed badly in his Fox News interview.
",-1
"The White House demanded a final up and down vote on Tuesday; by Wednesday, he was saying that the nomination would die if Kavanaugh didn’t do well before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
",-1
"A botched nomination matters because allies will be less likely to trust Trump, not just on Supreme Court choices, but on any initiative.
",-1
"And, for that matter, they’ll be less likely to trust him when he asserts that there’s nothing remaining for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to reveal.
",-1
"Trump’s professional reputation is already terrible, but everything counts.
",-1
"Trump is hurting himself right now, and will have hurt himself more if Kavanaugh is not confirmed.
",-1
"I've argued that too much disclosure is required, and that Democrats (and any wavering Republicans) had more than enough information to make up their mind.
",-1
"I still think that's true.
",-1
"In the event, that's not what's causing the trouble, but still it's an example of Trump taking needless risks.
",-1
"Some have speculated that Kavanaugh would be especially likely to rule in Trump's favor if any cases stemming from the Robert Mueller investigation wind up at the high court.
",-1
"Perhaps.
",-1
"And if Kavanaugh is really an outlier on that issue, then he won't be in the majority on any future decision anyway.
",-1
"So, no, I don't think there's any good reason to think Kavanaugh would be especially helpful to Trump compared to others he could have selected.

"Domestic abuse allegations against Keith Ellison cannot be substantiated, Dems' lawyer says
",-1
"A lawyer hired by Minnesota Democrats says she is unable to substantiate the accusations of domestic abuse against Rep. Keith Ellison because the lawmaker’s ex-girlfriend refused to provide video of the incident - but the findings are still being turned over to law enforcement.
",-1
"The Associated Press on Monday reported that it obtained a draft of a report written by Susan Ellingstad, a lawyer hired by Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party to investigate the claim against Ellison.
",-1
"""The investigation report, which was released today without our knowledge by someone outside of our organization, was unable to substantiate the claim of physical abuse made by Ms. Monahan,” DFL Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement.
",-1
"Martin said they planned to turn over the report to local law enforcement.
",-1
"“For the purpose of objectivity and getting all of the facts regarding these allegations, we have decided to forward the information in the investigation to local authorities in order to let them review the contents and determine whether further investigation is warranted,” Martin said.
",-1
"The Democratic congressman, who serves as deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has denied the allegations.
",-1
"In a statement, Ellison thanked Ellingstad for conducting a ""thorough, independent, and fair review.""
",-1
"""I believe women who come forward must be heard, and to have their allegations fully investigated,"" Ellison said.
",-1
"""This is why I have complied with this investigation fully, and will do so with any other inquiries.
",-1
"... At this time, I will be focusing on the issues of this important election.""
",-1
"Ellison’s ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, alleged in August that Ellison dragged her off a bed by her feet while screaming obscenities at her in 2016.
",-1
"Monahan said she had video footage of the incident and levied the allegation just days ahead of a crowded Democratic primary for Minnesota attorney general that Ellison went on to win.
",-1
"The state's Democratic party launched an investigation into the claim, retaining a local attorney with links to the state party to determine whether the alleged incident took place.
",-1
"Democratic party chairman Ken Martin said last week he expected the investigation to conclude soon.
",-1
"A draft report obtained by the AP noted Monahan's shifting rationale for refusing to produce the video footage, including that it was lost, was on a USB drive in storage and would be too embarrassing and traumatic to release it.
",-1
"The Ellison accusations have put Democrats in an uncomfortable position, as they speak out on sexual misconduct claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
",-1
"Kavanaugh denies the accusations.
",-1
"Monahan slammed the Democratic Party for its response to her allegations when compared to its treatment of Christine Blasey Ford.
",-1
"Ford has accused Kavanaugh of attempting to force himself onto her during a high school party nearly four decades ago.
",-1
"Many prominent Democrats have supported Ford’s allegations.
",-1
"“No, they don't,” Monahan tweeted in response to a question of whether the party believes women’s stories.
",-1
"“I've been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party.
",-1
"I provided medical records from 2017, stating on two different Dr.
",-1
"Visits, I told them about the abuse and who did it.
",-1
"My therapist released records stating I have been dealing and healing from the abuse.”
",-1
"She added: “Four people, including my supervisor at the time, stated that I came to them after and shared the exact story I shared publicly, I shared multiple text between me and Keith, where I discuss the abuse with him and much more.
",-1
"As I said before, I knew I wouldn't be believed.”
",-1
"Many other Democrats and progressives – who largely stayed silent after the accusations against Ellison emerged – came out in support of Ford, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, who urged to investigate the claims and Kavanaugh.
",-1
"Monahan went to reiterate that her story has nothing to do with politics.
",-1
"“I have nothing to prove to anyone, I simply shared my story.
",-1
"People can believe it or not.
",-1
"I don’t need anyone to affirm my humanity, I affirmed it,” she wrote in another tweet.
",-1
"“Do you think a person who has dealt with any form of abuse by politicians is thinking about politics?
",-1
"No, we & are families are trying to heal.”
",-1
"The president on Monday afternoon ordered that the documents be released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department “[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency,” according to a statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.
",-1
"It is not immediately clear how and when the documents will be released, but by Monday evening, intelligence agencies said they had already begun working to prepare the documents.
",-1
"“When the President issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House Counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America’s national security interests,” a Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News.
",-1
"“The Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President’s order.”
",-1
"ODNI spokeswoman Kellie Wade also said that the agency was “working expeditiously with our interagency partners to conduct a declassification review of the documents the President has identified for declassification.”
",-1
"The documents include all FBI reports on interviews, also known as 302s, with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with applications to surveil Carter Page, as well as 21 pages of one renewed warrant.
",-1
"The 21 pages make up only a small portion of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in a heavily redacted format.
",-1
"The June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year.
",-1
"Comey was fired from the bureau in May 2017; McCabe was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in March; Page left the bureau in May; and Strzok was fired last month.
",-1
"A source familiar with the timing of the declassification told Fox News they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first, followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr.
",-1
"The source added that the Justice Department is working on a ""compressed timeline"" and they expect the first release of records in days or sooner.
",-1
"Congressional Republicans are hoping the files reveal details about the start of the Russia investigation led by the FBI, which evolved into Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.

"Democrats, weeks later, released their own version of the memo.

"Trump's North Korean gamble ends with 'special bond' with Kim
",-1
"But there were scant details on what new commitments had been secured from Kim, even as Trump announced he would end the regular military exercises the US conducts with South Korea.
",-1
"Whether nuclear disarmament is indeed the final outcome of Tuesday's summit won't be known for years, if not decades.
",-1
"""We both want to do something.
",-1
"We both are going to do something.
",-1
"And we have developed a very special bond,"" Trump said at the conclusion of the landmark summit.
",-1
"People are going to be very happy.""
",-1
"In exchange, Trump agreed to ""provide security guarantees"" to North Korea.
",-1
"But there was no mentioning the previous US aim of ""complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.""
",-1
"And Kim's commitments did not appear to go beyond what he already pledged to do in April when he met South Korean President Moon Jae-in along their countries' border.
",-1
"Trump insisted during a news conference the agreement went further than many people expected.
",-1
"But he acknowledged the effort to rid North Korea of its nuclear arsenal was in its early stages.
",-1
"""We will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done,"" he said.
",-1
"""I think our whole relationship with North Korea and the Korean Peninsula is going to be a very much different situation than it has in the past,"" Trump said during the summit.
",-1
"Later, during his news conference, Trump said Warmbier's death contributed to the summit taking place.

"The remarks came amid an improbable series of events that few could have anticipated even three months ago.
",-1
"The unlikely images of US and North Korean counterparts engaging in friendly dialogue lent the day an air of unreality.
",-1
"In a detailed menu, the White House said the men were served Häagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream for dessert.
",-1
"Immediately after the encounter, Dennis Rodman -- one of the only Americans to have met Kim -- was openly weeping while being interviewed by CNN's Chris Cuomo.
",-1
"""Many people in the world will think of this as a (inaudible) form of fantasy ... from a science fiction movie,"" his translator was overheard saying as the two leaders walked down a white-columned colonnade.
",-1
"""We learned a lot about each other and our countries,"" Trump said.
",-1
"The day began with Trump patting Kim on the back and placing his hand on the North Korean's shoulder as they walked into their first meeting.
",-1
"Later they were seen smiling and laughing over lunch.
",-1
"The meeting came only months after the two men traded nuclear taunts, ratcheting up tensions and leading to fears of war.
",-1
"By contrast, Trump appeared to back off a military footing on Tuesday, declaring the US will stop the ""war games,"" an apparent reference to joint military exercises with South Korea that North Korea has long rebuked as provocative.
",-1
"Trump also said he hopes to eventually withdraw US forces from South Korea, but said ""that's not part of the equation right now.""
",-1
"""But that's not part of the equation right now.
",-1
"I hope it will be eventually.""
",-1
"Tuesday's meeting, convened at a luxury hotel on the island of Sentosa, came just three months after Trump accepted North Korea's invitation for talks on the spot.
",-1
"It was an extraordinarily compressed timeline for the landmark summit, which at one point was called off entirely as communication broke down between Washington and Pyongyang.
",-1
"The talks were quickly revived, leading to the highly choreographed event that unfolded Tuesday.
",-1
"After the men shook hands, they repaired inside for one-on-one talks.
",-1
"In that first meeting they were joined only by translators, a break from standard practice of having at least one aide present for high-stakes huddles.
",-1
"Later in the day, advisers joined the talks for a larger bilateral session and a working lunch.
",-1
"At the same time, he'd admitted he didn't believe he required extensive preparation to take stock of Kim.
",-1
"As part of the advance work, Trump commissioned a highly produced video meant to convince Kim to relinquish his weapons and open his country to outside investment.
",-1
"Trump showed Kim the movie on an iPad during their talks.
",-1
"He was spotted taking a moonlit stroll around the high-end Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino, owned by GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, the type of glitzy development few North Koreans could ever imagine coming to their country.

"A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge
",-1
"Gym is Trenton Tolliver’s favorite class.
",-1
"He gets to play matching games about Bible stories and listen to classic tales.
",-1
"Noah and the Ark is a favorite.
",-1
"Adam and Eve and the garden of Eden, of course.
",-1
"And the story about how their son Cain killed his brother, Abel.
",-1
"“That one was a little bit of a surprise,” Trenton said as he sat with his parents, Brett and Courtney Tolliver, one day this month watching his little sister’s soccer practice on a lush field in this small town in the mountains of southern West Virginia.
",-1
"This spring, Bible classes such as Trenton’s are on the minds of many here in Mercer County.
",-1
"For decades, the county’s public schools have offered a weekly Bible class during the school day — 30 minutes at the elementary level and 45 minutes in middle school.
",-1
"Bible classes on school time are a rarity in public education, but here they are a long-standing tradition.
",-1
"The program is not mandatory, but almost every child in the district attends.
",-1
"And there is widespread support for the classes: Parents and community members help raise nearly $500,000 a year to pay for the Bible in the Schools program.
",-1
"Now Bible in the Schools is facing a stiff legal challenge.
",-1
"Two county residents with school-age children argue in a lawsuit that the program violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment and the West Virginia constitution.
",-1
"Filed in January and amended last month by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the suit charges that the Bible class “advances and endorses one religion, improperly entangles public schools in religious affairs, and violates the personal consciences of nonreligious and non-Christian parents and students.”
",-1
"Supporters are adamant that the weekly class is an elective meant to explore the history and literature of the Bible, not to promote religious belief.
",-1
"“My experience with it has been very positive.
",-1
"I’ve never known of anyone who has been pressured or felt ostracized,” said the Rev.
",-1
"David W. Dockery, senior pastor at First Baptist Church of Princeton.
",-1
"Trenton’s parents also find it hard to see why there would be objections.
",-1
"“I think it’s a great program mainly because it’s the only chance for some of these kids to even see the Bible,” said Brett Tolliver, 27.
",-1
"“More importantly, I don’t know who it harms.
",-1
"The kids aren’t forced to be there.”
",-1
"Courtney Tolliver, 26, a teacher in the district, agrees.
",-1
"“It’s not teaching religion, but it teaches character and respect and how important it is to tell the truth,” she said.
",-1
"“The kids love it and the ones who don’t participate aren’t made to feel left out.”
",-1
"But the plaintiffs in the suit and their backers argue that the program’s popularity shouldn’t matter in the face of Supreme Court rulings such as McCollum v. Board of Education in 1948 that have banned public schools from initiating or sponsoring religious activity.
",-1
"The suit alleges that the lessons in the Mercer schools are similar to what a child would hear in Sunday school and that they advocate the Ten Commandments and treat stories in the Bible as historical fact.
",-1
"The suit quotes from one lesson: “If all of the Israelites had chosen to follow the Ten Commandments, think of how safe and happy they would have been.” Another lesson asks students to imagine that humans and dinosaurs existed at the same time.
",-1
"It says: “So picture Adam being able to crawl up on the back of a dinosaur!
",-1
"He and Eve could have their own personal water slide!
",-1
"Wouldn’t that be so wild!”
",-1
"The district declined a request to observe one of the classes.
",-1
"Elizabeth Deal, who describes herself as agnostic, is one of the plaintiffs in the case.
",-1
"Her daughter attended elementary school in nearby Bluefield, but Deal kept her out of the Bible class.
",-1
"Even though the class was optional, Deal said there weren’t any alternative lessons or activities for those who opted out.
",-1
"Her daughter was told to sit in the computer lab for that half-hour and read a book.
",-1
"One day a student saw her daughter reading a “Harry Potter” novel and told her, according to the mother: “You don’t need to be reading this.
",-1
"You need to be reading the Bible.”
",-1
"Eventually Deal moved her daughter to a public school a few miles away in Virginia where there is no Bible class.
",-1
"She pays an out-of-state fee of several hundred dollars, but she no longer worries about her child being taunted.
",-1
"“When something is wrong,” she said, “you have to stand up against it.”
",-1
"God is a big deal in Mercer County, home to about 125 churches that dominate the main streets of its biggest towns, Princeton (population 6,400) and Bluefield (10,400), and smaller burgs such as Athens (1,000), Bramwell (360) and Oakvale (120).
",-1
"A lot of the good jobs in the county have left — 22 percent of its 61,000 residents live below the poverty level — but the churches have stayed.
",-1
"You can find the Church of God here.
",-1
"And the Church of Christ.
",-1
"And the Church of Jesus.
",-1
"There are a couple of Catholic churches, a synagogue and a mosque, but the vast majority of houses of worship are Baptist, Methodist or Pentecostal.
",-1
"The radio in the region is filled with gospel stations, Bible talk shows and Christian rock.
",-1
"Billboards tout the Ten Commandments or offer stern messages on abortion and eternal salvation.
",-1
"Beneath a Chick-fil-A billboard in Princeton, another asks: “If you die tonight.
",-1
"Heaven or Hell?”
",-1
"The Rev.
",-1
"Ray Hurt has been the lead pastor at the Church of God in Princeton for more than two decades.
",-1
"The church, one of the largest buildings in town, can hold up to 2,000 people for Sunday services and often does.
",-1
"For Hurt, Bible in the Schools, which has been in the public schools here in one form or another since 1939, is simply a way for students to further their knowledge.
",-1
"“There is a great deal of not just poetry and prose in the Bible, but from what I’ve read almost every piece of history that’s in the Bible has eventually been proven,” he said.
",-1
"“We see the Bible not just as a book of faith but as a pretty accurate account of history that informs us about a lot of things that happened.”
",-1
"Hurt, whose son, the Rev.
",-1
"J.B. Hurt, is also a minister in the Church of God and a member of the county school board, says he would oppose the program if he thought it was being used to teach religion or if students were required to take the class.
",-1
"But he also embraces the idea that the Bible offers irrefutable lessons in morality and teaches the difference between right and wrong.
",-1
"“If you read the Bible, you’re going to get a whole lot of good ideas that are going to stick with you and make you a better person,” he said.
",-1
"“You don’t have to push religion with it.
",-1
"It speaks for itself in terms of morals and ethics and those things.”
",-1
"The idea that a weekly Bible class for 6,600 students in 16 public elementary schools and three middle schools is somehow simply an academic offering doesn’t sit well with Lynne White, 54, a former two-term school board member and mother of two sons who went through Mercer schools.
",-1
"“As a person of faith myself, I don’t see any problem with having an after-school Bible program,” White said.
",-1
"White holds the school board and leadership responsible for spreading what she says is a false sense of what the Bible in the Schools program is and does.
",-1
"She argued that the classes are character education based on biblical values, that they were not electives because West Virginia doesn’t offer electives in elementary or middle school and that even though the classes are funded by private donations, that doesn’t mean they should be taught during the instructional day.
",-1
"She also said it was untrue that children who didn’t take the class weren’t made to “feel different or ostracized.”
",-1
"When White posted the article on Facebook, she heard from some supporters, but many others questioned her faith.
",-1
"“I will pray for you and all non-believers Lynne White.
",-1
"God Bless!
",-1
"!” one wrote.
",-1
"Another wrote:
",-1
"If it were simply a popularity contest, Bible in the Schools would be allowed to continue as is.
",-1
"Even the president of the local mosque in Princeton says it should stay.
",-1
"“It’s good to be God-fearing no matter how you approach it,” said Mohammad Iqbal, head of the Islamic Society of the Appalachian Region.
",-1
"“Whether it’s the Bible, whether it’s Koran, whether it’s Torah, whether it’s some other book.
",-1
"But it should be optional, not enforced.
",-1
"If the parents have no objection and the student has no objection, it is okay.”
",-1
"But the program’s fate will not be resolved by popular vote or on Facebook posts.
",-1
"Instead, the question will be tried in the courtroom of Judge David A. Faber of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia in Bluefield.
",-1
"(Faber was nominated by President George H.W.
",-1
"Bush.)
",-1
"Representing the Mercer school district is the First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit law firm based in Texas that specializes in religious freedom cases.
",-1
"Hiram Sasser, a lawyer at the firm, said the district’s main objective is to allow the Bible course to remain as an elective while making sure it complies with the law.
",-1
"The district filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on Wednesday.
",-1
"“There are two things to look at,” Sasser said.
",-1
"“The first is whether you can have a Bible course at all.
",-1
"And the other is whether you can have the Bible course as it is presently constituted.
",-1
"It’s fair to say that we’re very confident on the first issue.
",-1
"And on the second issue .
",-1
".
",-1
"But the plaintiffs aren’t looking for flexibility.
",-1
"They want the Bible class out of the school day.
",-1
"The program “is unconstitutional at its core and cannot be saved via modifications,” said Patrick Elliott, a lawyer with the Freedom From Religion Foundation.
",-1
"“There is no legally permissible way for Mercer County Schools to continue with any type of program like this.”
",-1
"The amended complaint, Elliott said, seeks to prevent the school system from “organizing, administering, or otherwise endorsing Bible classes for Mercer County Schools’ students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade.”
",-1
"Charles C. Haynes, the founding director of the Religious Freedom Center at the Newseum in Washington, doesn’t foresee the program surviving a court challenge in its current form.
",-1
"“This is a loser for the school district,” Haynes said.
",-1
"“It’s difficult to satisfy the First Amendment in elementary school when it comes to the Bible.
",-1
"Students at that age really aren’t prepared to tell the difference between what is history and what is religious conviction.”
",-1
"Haynes argues that people of faith are doing their religion a disservice when they try to have it taught by a government entity.
",-1
"They would rightly object, he said, if they lived somewhere where they were the religious minority and supporters of another religion wanted a course on their faith taught in public schools.
",-1
"Trenton Tolliver is oblivious to the Bible battle that swirls around him.
",-1
"His first-grade school year ends next month.
",-1
"Hanging in the balance of the court case is what he will learn in the Bible course in second grade.
",-1
"Or if there will be a Bible course at all.

"CNN’s Jim Acosta Has Press Pass Restored by White House
",-1
"Jim Acosta has his press pass back.
",-1
"The Trump administration stood down on Monday from its nearly two-week-long dispute with CNN over the White House credentials of Mr. Acosta, informing the correspondent that his badge was formally restored.
",-1
"Among the guidelines was a restriction of one question per reporter, with follow-ups allowed at the discretion of the president or the White House official at the lectern.
",-1
"“Failure to abide,” the administration warned, “may result in suspension or revocation of the journalist’s hard pass.”
",-1
"The American Civil Liberties Union, in a statement, said: “These rules give the White House far too much discretion to avoid real scrutiny.
",-1
"The White House belongs to the public, not the president, and the job of the press is to ask hard questions, not to be polite company.”
",-1
"Still, the guidelines are not far removed from the manner in which White House news conferences typically proceed.
",-1
"Mr. Trump made clear last week that he would introduce “regulations” after a federal judge criticized the White House for stripping Mr. Acosta’s credentials without due process or a coherent rationale.
",-1
"“We would have greatly preferred to continue hosting White House press conferences in reliance on a set of understood professional norms, and we believe the overwhelming majority of journalists covering the White House share that preference,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, said in a statement.
",-1
"Press relations were not always rosy in pre-Trump days.
",-1
"President Barack Obama’s aides preselected the news outlets that were allowed to ask questions at his news conferences.
",-1
"He has held far fewer formal news conferences than his predecessors, and the daily White House briefing has virtually disappeared on his watch.
",-1
"A back-and-forth ensued over the weekend.
",-1
"Bill Shine, the deputy chief of staff for communications, sent a letter to Mr. Acosta that listed several reasons that his pass had been revoked, perhaps an attempt to satisfy the judge’s request for a clear rationale.
",-1
"CNN’s lawyers called the note an “after-the-fact concocted process.” By Monday afternoon, the sides had reached a resolution.
",-1
"Aides to Mr. Trump say that the president does not mind answering questions, pointing to his numerous impromptu sessions with reporters during White House photo-ops and Marine One departures.
",-1
"“The White House’s interaction is, and generally should be, subject to a natural give-and-take,” Ms. Sanders wrote on Monday, suggesting that the onus was on the press corps to ensure that a “code of conduct” did not become necessary.
",-1
"“For as long as there have been White House press conferences, White House reporters have asked follow-up questions,” the group wrote on Monday.
",-1
"“We fully expect this tradition will continue.”

"Paul Manafort Secretly Met With Julian Assange Shortly Before Joining Trump's Presidential Campaign: Report
",-1
"A British newspaper alleges that Paul Manafort secretly met WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London within days or weeks of being brought aboard Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
",-1
"Lawyers for Assange and Manafort denounced the report as false.
",-1
"If confirmed, the report Tuesday would suggest a direct connection between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, which released tens of thousands of emails stolen by Russian spies during the 2016 election.
",-1
"The campaign seized on the emails to undermine Trump’s rival, Hillary Clinton.
",-1
"The Guardian, which did not identify the sources for its reporting, said that Manafort met with Assange “around March 2016” — the same month that Russian hackers began their all-out effort to steal emails from the Clinton campaign.
",-1
"“I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him,” Manafort said.
",-1
"“I have never been contacted by anyone connected to WikiLeaks, either directly or indirectly.
",-1
"Assange’s Ecuadorean lawyer, Carlos Poveda, said the Guardian report was false.
",-1
"The Guardian cited two unidentified sources as saying Manafort first met Assange at the embassy in 2013, a year after Assange took refuge there to avoid being extradited to Sweden over sex crime allegations.
",-1
"The Guardian said Manafort returned there in 2015 and 2016 and said its sources had “tentatively dated” the final visit to March.
",-1
"The newspaper added that Manafort’s visit was not entered into the embassy’s log book and cited a source as saying Manafort left after 40 minutes.
",-1
"There was no detail on what might have been discussed.
",-1
"The Trump campaign announced Manafort’s hire on March 29, 2016, and he served as the convention manager tasked with lining up delegates for the Republican National Convention.
",-1
"He was promoted to campaign chairman in May 2016.

"Why Louis Farrakhan Is Back in the News
",-1
"Louis Farrakhan, the 84-year-old head of the Nation of Islam, has been back in the headlines after a previously unreleased photo of him with President Barack Obama was published in January and Mr. Farrakhan gave an anti-Semitic speech at his organization’s annual convention last month.
",-1
"The Feb. 25 speech, which was given at an event for Saviour’s Day, a religious gathering of the Nation, ran for almost three hours.
",-1
"Mr. Farrakhan has denied that he is anti-Semitic and has even said that his father may have been Jewish.
",-1
"Much of the recent coverage has been focused on Tamika Mallory, one of the heads of the Women’s March organization, who attended the Feb. 25 speech, and on Representative Danny Davis, a Democrat of Illinois, who defended Mr. Obama and Mr. Farrakhan after the photo came to light.
",-1
"What is the Nation of Islam?
",-1
"The Nation of Islam is a political and religious movement that was started by W.D.
",-1
"Fard Muhammad in 1931 and continued by Elijah Muhammad in 1933.
",-1
"It first became prominent after a man named Malcolm Little joined the organization.
",-1
"Encouraged by Elijah Muhammad, he changed his last name to X and became a minister in the movement.
",-1
"Edward E. Curtis IV, the author of “Black Muslim Religion in the Nation of Islam,” said that while estimates ranged wildly about how many bona fide members belonged to the Nation, he believes that there were tens of thousands of members in the 1960s and early 1970s.
",-1
"But he said that millions of others sympathized with the movement’s anticolonial stance and were inspired by its most famous member, Muhammad Ali.
",-1
"Who is Louis Farrakhan?
",-1
"Born Louis Eugene Walcott in New York in 1933, Mr. Farrakhan joined the Nation of Islam in the mid-1950s and rose quickly within the organization, becoming close to Malcolm X.
",-1
"After the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, he became one of the most powerful members of the Nation and its chief spokesman, the position that Malcolm X had held.
",-1
"The Nation of Islam had gained followers around the nation in the 1940s and ’50s by providing something of a religious answer to antiblack racism.
",-1
"That political position became a vehicle for Mr. Farrakhan to express his anti-Semitism.
",-1
"In 1975, when Elijah Muhammad died, the Nation split into two factions.
",-1
"The faction reconstituted under Mr. Farrakhan in the late 1970s retained the original name, though not the influence or support that it had when its leaders were Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali and Elijah Muhammad.
",-1
"Mr. Curtis said that today the membership could be in the thousands, and there could even be as many as 10,000 followers.
",-1
"Mr. Farrakhan, whose name, the Anti-Defamation League wrote after the February event, is “virtually synonymous with anti-Semitism,” then drew national attention in 1984, when he exhorted his followers to support Jesse Jackson’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
",-1
"In a radio address, he urged listeners to “make an example” of a Washington Post reporter who had reported that Mr. Jackson had used anti-Semitic terms in private.
",-1
"Mr. Jackson repudiated Mr. Farrakhan, but the minister’s support proved troublesome to his 1988 campaign as well.
",-1
"He was back in the news in 1995 when he organized what became known as the “Million Man March,” a political and religious revival event in Washington.
",-1
"On March 3, she said on Twitter that someone had brought to her attention that she had yet to tweet “my absolute position on how wrong anti-Semitism is.” A day later, she said that she was “committed to ending anti-black racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia & transphobia,” but did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.
",-1
"In an essay posted Wednesday, she said that she had been attending Saviour’s Day celebrations for over 30 years.
",-1
"“In that most difficult period of my life, it was the women of the Nation of Islam who supported me and I have always held them close to my heart for that reason,” she said.
",-1
"The essay did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.
",-1
"Asked what the appeal of Mr. Farrakhan’s views might be to people like Ms. Mallory, religious scholars emphasized that the Nation of Islam is a religion and can provide comfort and aid to its adherents.
",-1
"“For those who find it appealing, it is a form of radical black self love that is willing to challenge any potential impediment to black freedom,” Mr. Curtis said.
",-1
"Yvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore who called Mr. Farrakhan’s remarks about Jews “unbelievably vile,” emphasized that his fundamentalism was comparable to the fundamentalist views found in other religions.
",-1
"Coincidentally, the photo of Mr. Farrakhan and Mr. Obama had been published by the Trice Edney News Wire in January.
",-1
"The News Wire reported that the picture had been taken by the photojournalist Askia Muhammad during a 2005 meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus and that Mr. Muhammad kept the photo under wraps so as not to hurt Mr. Obama’s candidacy.
",-1
"(Mr. Muhammad, in a 2012 blog post, said that he was an admirer of Mr. Farrakhan and that the minister was not an anti-Semite.
",-1
"Katie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said on Friday: “President Obama has denounced racism and anti-Semitism his entire life.
",-1
"That includes his public and repeated repudiations of Louis Farrakhan’s views over the years.
",-1
"Swedish PM does not rule out use of army to end gang violence
",-1
"Sweden will do whatever it takes, including sending in the army, to end a wave of gang violence that has seen a string of deadly shootings, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said in Wednesday.
",-1
"Sweden’s murder rate is relatively low in international terms, but gang violence has surged in recent years and Swedes are worried that the police are unable to cope.
",-1
"In 2016, the latest year for which official statistics are available, 106 people were murdered in Sweden, a country of 10 million.
",-1
"But Swedish TV reported there were over 300 shootings, mostly in turf battles between gangs over drugs, protection rackets and prostitution.
",-1
"Four people were shot dead in the first week of this year.
",-1
"One man died after picking up a hand grenade outside a subway station in a suburb of Stockholm.
",-1
"Law and order is likely to be a major issue in a parliamentary election scheduled for September with the populist, opposition Sweden Democrats linking public concern about the rising crime rate to a large increase in the numbers of immigrants.
",-1
"The government has promised police an extra 7.1 billion crowns ($880 million) through 2020, toughened laws on gun crimes and made it easier for the police to monitor private phone calls and emails, among other measures.
",-1
"But a report by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention shows increasing numbers of Swedes worried about crime with confidence falling in the police and the judicial system.
",-1
"“People are shot to death in pizza restaurants, people are killed by hand grenades they find on the street,” Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson said in parliament on Wednesday.
",-1
"Florida shooting: Gun control law moves step closer
",-1
"The state's House of Representatives passed a bill raising the age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 and imposing a three-day waiting period on all gun sales.
",-1
"The bill, already passed by the Senate, now goes to the state governor.
",-1
"Seventeen people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on 14 February.
",-1
"Expelled former student Nikolas Cruz, 19, has been charged in the attack.
",-1
"He was formally indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday on 34 counts, including 17 counts of premeditated first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder.
",-1
"He is suspected of using a legally bought AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to carry out the 10-minute attack, gunning down teachers and students.
",-1
"What is in the new law?
",-1
"In addition to raising the age and bringing in the three-day waiting period, the legislation:
",-1
"Introduces a voluntary armed ""guardian programme"" for schools, named after Aaron Feis, a coach who died in the Parkland shooting.
",-1
"It allows school personnel to be armed, subject to school district approval and specialist training
",-1
"Classroom teachers are excluded from carrying arms unless they have a security forces background
",-1
"Bans devices, such as bump stocks, that modify a semi-automatic weapon to fully automatic
",-1
"Raises mental health funding and increases the power to seize or ban guns under mental health concerns
",-1
"The legislation does not include a ban on the sale of assault-style weapons like the AR-15, despite it being a key demand of Parkland students and their parents.
",-1
"Florida law already mandates a three-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun but a person as young as 18 can buy a rifle with no waiting period.
",-1

"Wait!
",-1
"It’s all a MISTRANSLATION!
",-1
"Yet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel.
",-1
"It can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one’s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal.
",-1
"In other words, the conscience can “inform” a sinner that his continued sinning is not only acceptable to God but is even what God is asking “for now,” given one’s particular “limits.” This outrageous proposition, a form of situation ethics that strikes at the very foundation of Catholic moral teaching, has justly provoked a storm of criticism from lay and clerical defenders of the authentic Magisterium.
",-1
"But it’s all a misunderstanding, say Dr. Robert Fastiggi, professor of Systematic Theology at Sacred Heart Major Seminary, and Dr.
",-1
"Dawn Eden Goldstein, S.T.D., professor of Dogmatic Theology at Holy Apostles College and Seminary.
",-1
"All of the critics of AL are wrong—every one of them!—because, you see, the original Latin text does not say what the English text does.
",-1
"Dr. Robert Fastiggi and Dr.
",-1
"Dawn Goldstein
",-1
"Here we go again.
",-1
"So what does the Latin say?
",-1
"Here is the paragraph in the official Latin:
",-1
"Haec autem conscientia agnoscere potest non modo statum quendam ab universali Evangelii mandato obiective dissidere; etiam sincere honesteque agnoscere poteste quod sit liberale responsum in praesenti Deo reddendum atque eadem conscientia firma quadam morali certitudine intellegere illam esse oblationem quam ipse Deus requirit inter rerum impedientium congeriem, quamvis perfectum nondum sit obiectivum exemplar.
",-1
"Yes, and so what?
",-1
"Well, according to Fastiggi and Goldstein, while the English translation reads: “what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God,” the Latin employs the word oblationem, which means offering.
",-1
"So, What the Pope Really Means® is: “what for now is the most generous offering which can be given to God.” So, it’s an offering to God, not a response to God.
",-1
"Big difference.
",-1
"But just a moment: how can objectively immoral behavior ever be characterized as an “offering” to God?
",-1
"It would seem the Latin version has graver implications than the English because it suggests that falling short of what the moral law requires is an oblation pleasing to God if one’s “limits” make obedience to the moral law difficult.
",-1
"Fastiggi and Goldstein have managed to make the problem even worse in their attempt to explain it away.
",-1
"What about the English locution “while yet not fully the objective ideal,” which seems to reduce the negative precepts of the natural law to mere ideals?
",-1
"Not so, Fastiggi and Goldstein contend.
",-1
"Give.
",-1
"Me.
",-1
"A.
",-1
"Break.
",-1
"A pattern or model to follow is an ideal, as a standard Latin dictionary confirms with its definition of exemplar: “(1) copy/reproduction, (2) model, pattern, example, original, ideal.
",-1
"Likewise, the definition of the English word “exemplar” is simply: “an ideal model.”
",-1
"Here too Fastiggi and Goldsetein only worsen the problem they try to explain away.
",-1
"For if moral behavior is now to be viewed as merely “exemplary” rather than divinely mandated by the natural law that binds all men—including Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery—then basic morality becomes a kind of heroic virtue.
",-1
"Thus, continence cannot realistically be expected, at least “for now” (AL 303), of the average Joe or Jane with an “ex” who has “remarried” and is now mired in the “concrete complexity one’s limits.”
",-1
"According to their proposed “alternate translation” into English, What the Pope Really Means® is that objectively immoral behavior one feels unable to correct due to one’s “limits” is “the offering that God himself is asking amid the mass of impediments, although it may not yet be the perfect objective model.” Which is what the official English translation already says but with fewer words.
",-1
"It seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice that their linguistic tinkering produces no real change in meaning but only an intensification of its perniciousness.
",-1
"Indeed, their “proposed alternate translation” reduces the avoidance of adulterous relations in “second marriages” to the “perfect objective model.” Now, how could anyone but a Pharisee expect perfection from people living in adultery?
",-1
"Are you perfect?
",-1
"Then again, the Pharisees are precisely the ones Our Lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law.
",-1
"And Fastiggi and Goldstein are busily helping it along, changing red signals to green.
",-1
"No problem here!
",-1
"has been the mantra of the neo-Catholic establishment for nearly half a century of ecclesial auto-demolition.
",-1
"But the Fastiggi-Goldstein interpretation is precisely the contrary of the interpretation Francis has assiduously promoted and which Fastiggi and Goldstein just as assiduously ignore: i.e., that people in “second marriages” do not have to live in continence, but rather—in “certain cases”—may continue their adulterous relations while receiving absolution and Holy Communion during a “process of discernment.” As we know, in his letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires, published on the Vatican website (in response to a query he himself may have solicited), Bergoglio informed them “there is no other interpretation.”
",-1
"Moreover, the Maltese bishops' “guidelines” for implementing AL, published in L’Osservatore Romano—for which Bergoglio thanked them—declare thus:
",-1
"If, as a result of the process of discernment, undertaken with “humility, discretion and love for the Church and her teaching, in a sincere search for God’s will and a desire to make a more perfect response to it” (AL 300), a separated or divorced person who is living in a new relationship manages, with an informed and enlightened conscience, to acknowledge and believe that he or she are at peace with God, he or she cannot be precluded from participating in the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (see AL, notes 336 and 351).
",-1
"This Pope’s plan of promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document whose heterodox interpretation and application he would later approve with a series of sub-magisterial winks and nods, both oral and written, is the reason I signed onto the Correctio Filialis.
",-1
"See the piece by Joseph Shaw in this regard.
",-1
"Shaw maintains that AL can be “bent into some kind of orthodoxy.” Perhaps.
",-1
"But it is not our responsibility to bend a Pope’s statements into conformity with the Faith.
",-1
"Moreover, any Pope who promulgates a document that can be read as orthodox only by a forced interpretation imposed by certain readers—while others disagree—has by that very fact inflicted grave harm upon on the Church, which he alone has the duty to correct.
",-1
"But Francis, as any reasonable observer can see, has no intention of offering any such correction.
",-1
"As Shaw observes of AL: “What we [the signers of the Correctio] are saying is that it has become clear that orthodoxy is not what Pope Francis wants us to find there.”
",-1
"But Bergoglio wants the effects of heresy—undermining Holy Matrimony, Confession and Holy Communion, whose integrity is affirmed verbally—without the guilt of an explicit promulgation.
",-1
"In so acting, he is very much in the mold of Honorius I, who was posthumously anathematized by an ecumenical council (the Third Council of Constantinople) and by his own successor (Leo II) for aiding and abetting the spread of the Monothelite heresy (no human but only a divine will in Christ).
",-1
"Honorius did so by means of private correspondence with the author of the heresy, endorsing the heresy without ever formally proclaiming it as doctrine.
",-1
"And yet Honorius I is listed in the canon of the Popes and is not considered to have fallen from office on account of heresy.
",-1
"A similar judgment might well befall this Pope, but it is not for us to level it.
",-1
"Meanwhile, as Fastiggi and Goldstein labor to convince us that nothing is amiss with AL, Pope Bergoglio is sending clear signals of concern about the rising opposition among the faithful to his master plan to subvert the Church according to his false notion of mercy.
",-1
"In a classic power move, he has just given a sop to Cardinal Burke, the perceived leader of the opposition, by appointing him to a minor position on the Apostolic Signatura—the same tribunal from which Bergoglio brutally removed him as Prefect.
",-1
"And this after also humiliating Burke as the spiritual patron of the Knights of Malta, to which he was exiled after his removal.
",-1
"Will this sop buy Burke’s silence, staving off the feared public correction?
",-1
"We will soon know if the Cardinal can be bought so easily.
",-1
"Israel Takes On the Shia Crescent
",-1
"Meanwhile, Syria has become ground zero for Iran's execution of its regional ambitions, which is to establish its Shiite Crescent connecting with its allies, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
",-1
"This plan has included the establishment of a land route that Iranian-backed militias secured in June, beginning on Iran’s border with Iraq and running across Iraq and Syria all the way to Syria’s Mediterranean coast.
",-1
"This road makes Iran’s job easier in supplying arms by land, as well as by air and sea, to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and to equip Iran’s own forces fighting inside of Syria in support of Assad.
",-1
"This helps explain why Iran has placed so much importance on helping the Syrian regime establish control over the Deir ez-Zor area in eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border.
",-1
"“Everything depends now on the Americans’ willingness to stop this,” said an Iraqi Kurdish official who was quoted in a New Yorker article.
",-1
"However, U.S.-led coalition forces apparently have done next to nothing to stop this major advance in Iran’s Shiite Crescent expansion.
",-1
"“Obama ran down our options in Syria so thoroughly, by the time this administration took over,” said Andrew Tabler, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
",-1
"“The Iranian influence is spreading because they are so heavily involved in regime activities,” Tabler added.
",-1
"“It’s a new monster.”
",-1
"Furthermore, Iran has funded and armed its terrorist proxy Hezbollah, which has sent its militia from its home base of Lebanon to fight alongside Assad's forces.
",-1
"And Iran has used Syria as a transit point for shipment of sophisticated rockets to Hezbollah in Lebanon for future use against Israeli population centers.
",-1
"While Israel chose not to take sides in Syria's civil war with military intervention of its own, it has bombed weapons storage facilities and convoys inside Syria for its own protection.
",-1
"Just recently, on September 7th, Israeli jets struck a Syrian weapons facility near Masyaf, which was reported to have been used for the production of chemical weapons and the storage of missiles.
",-1
"Israel will also do what is necessary to repel Iranian-backed forces if they edge too close to areas near the Golan Heights, shrinking the buffer between Israel and Iranian controlled territories.
",-1
"However, such tactical measures may not be enough to thwart Iran’s larger ambitions.
",-1
"In light of intelligence reports that Assad may be ready to invite Iran to set up military bases in Syria, Israeli leaders have concluded that they cannot wait until the Trump administration decides to deal more forcefully with Iran's growing use of Syria as a staging area for carrying out its expansionist Shiite Crescent strategy.
",-1
"“Their overriding concern in Syria is the free reign that all the major players there seem willing to afford Iran and its various proxies in the country,” wrote Jonathan Spyer in an article for Foreign Policy.
",-1
"As long as nobody else is addressing the concern Iran’s growing control raises in a satisfactory manner, “Israel is determined to continue addressing it on its own.”
",-1
"At least, Israel has a more sympathetic ear in the Trump administration than it did in the Obama administration for raising its concerns about Iran’s growing threat, not only to Israel but to U.S. interests in the region and beyond.
",-1
"As the U.S.-led coalition continues to drive ISIS from its bases of operation in Syria, the Trump administration has proclaimed its intention not to allow Iran to turn Syria into its own satellite, as Iran has essentially done in Iraq.
",-1
"National Security Adviser H.R.
",-1
"In the meantime, Israel will have to deal with the fallout of Iran’s ambitions in Syria itself.

"“He never even told me that he owned a gun,” continued the shooter’s neighbor, adding that Paddock did not express any religious or political opinions during their conversations.

"The caller mentioned how some people in the crowd were warned 45 minutes before the shooting that they were going to die, suggesting that this was evidence of a wider plot and not a “lone wolf” attack.

"As a firearms expert, he also questioned the lack of flashes coming from the hotel windows where the shooter was supposedly firing from.

"If Paddock was planning such a sophisticated operation and hoping to evade detection, he would not be blabbing details about it to his neighbors.

"Receipt Shows Paddock Had Another Guest in His Room Before Shooting
",-1
"This report was originally published by Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars
",-1
"An image posted on Facebook by a man who claims he served Stephen Paddock room service shows that the gunman was with a guest during his time at the Mandalay Bay hotel four days before the massacre took place.
",-1
"The receipt shows an employee named Antonio served two guests an “IRA_MB,” which means “In Room Dining, Mandalay Bay.”
",-1
"The table number is “32135” – which equates to Paddock’s room number (135) on the 32nd floor.
",-1
"Paddock ordered a burger, a bagel with cream cheese, a potato soup, one bottle of water and two Pepsis, suggesting that there was another person eating with him in the room.
",-1
"The receipt shows the number “2” next to the word “Guests”.
",-1
"The date on the receipt also says September 27, whereas authorities assert that Paddock checked in the day after on September 28.
",-1
"Paddock’s guest could not have been his girlfriend Marilou Danley because she was in the Philippines at the time.
",-1
"The individual who posted the receipt appears to have deleted it from his Facebook page, although the page still shows that he works at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.
",-1
"Another source told Laura Loomer that the gunman actually checked in on September 25, three days before authorities said he did.
",-1
"Source who works at @MandalayBay said #StephenPaddock had the suite since Sep. 25th.

"Why did police lie and say he checked in on Sep. 28th?

",-1
"Authorities must surely now be on the hunt for whoever Paddock dined with in order to ascertain whether this individual was involved in the plot and whether or not it was the same woman who reportedly told concert-goers they were “going to die” 45 minutes before the shooting took place.

"This throws their entire narrative into question and makes one wonder what else is being hidden from the public?
",-1
"Keep in mind that at least four videos from the scene of the shooting have already been released that indicate there were multiple shooters.

"In fact, there are so many unanswered questions that the Drudge Report even linked to an article asking them directly.

"Nevada Sheriff Joe Lombardo said police were investigating who leaked the crime scene photos.

"On Thursday, investigators revealed that the note in the photo was not, in fact, a suicide note but neglected to provide further details about the purpose of the note.
",-1
"In their first in-depth interview, which will air on CBS Sunday evening, the officers who stormed Stephen Paddock’s hotel room revealed new details to 60 Minutes that finally explain what was written on the mysterious note.
",-1
"“I could see on it he had written the distance, the elevation he was on, the drop of what his bullet was gonna be for the crowd,” said Officer Dave Newton from the Las Vegas Police in a preview clip of Sunday’s report.
",-1
"“So he had that written down and figured out so he would know where to shoot to hit his targets from there.”
",-1
"Paddock’s note was clearly not a suicide letter.
",-1
"Rather, it detailed bullet trajectory and included calculations about where he needed to aim his weapons to maximize accuracy and optimize his kill rate.

"Investigators have also been looking for a ‘mystery woman’ who was seen with Stephen Paddock in the days leading up to the Las Vegas shooting.

"The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event
",-1
"Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism.
",-1
"The American Jewish Historical Society was founded to study and preserve Jewish history.
",-1
"The fruits of the AJHS and JVP partnership have been a series of events attacking Israel.
",-1
"Coming up in late October is “The Balfour Declaration: Support for a Jewish Homeland or Jewish State?”
",-1
"The two speakers are Robert Herbst, the coordinator of the Westchester chapter of JVP, and Jonathan Kuttab, who advocates a one-state solution for eliminating Israel.
",-1
"He had tweeted, ""EU no longer considers #Hamas a terrorist group.
",-1
"Time for US to do same.""
",-1
"He justified hijacking planes, described suicide bombers as “taking the supreme sacrifice” and defended Hezbollah as “an armed-resistance movement”
",-1
"He has claimed that the ""Jewish community gradually consolidated its power, wealth, and influence in all sectors of society"" especially in ""crucial sectors like banking, finance, media” where ""their influence both as individuals and an organized community far exceeded their numbers"" and that their power strengthens “conspiracy theories about ‘Jewish control’ that are reminiscent of the infamous “’Protocols of the Elders of Zion.’”
",-1
"Robert Herbst and Jonathan Kuttab are both supporters of a one-state plan for eliminating Israel.
",-1
"The American Jewish Historical Society is co-sponsoring a JVP anti-Israel event by two opponents of Israel, one of whom has defended Hamas.
",-1
"An organization that hands out the Emma Lazarus Award, named after a passionate Zionist, at its posh dinners is hosting attacks on the existence of Israel.
",-1
"The “Jewish Homeland” or “Jewish State” argument is a hook for contending that the Balfour Declaration didn’t endorse Israel, but some sort of Jewish Bantustan within a Muslim country.
",-1
"That worked so well for the Christians and Jews of the Middle East.
",-1
"The American Jewish Historical Society is not only co-sponsoring a one-state event by an anti-Israel hate group.
",-1
"But it’s also hosting it at the Center for Jewish History’s headquarters.
",-1
"AJHS is a component of the Center for Jewish History.
",-1
"And the partnership between AJHS and JVP sheds light on the controversy over the appointment of David N. Myers, an anti-Israel activist, to head the Center for Jewish History.
",-1
"During the Myers controversy, the Center took pains to disassociate Myers and themselves from JVP because a JVP handout had listed him as a “JVP Academic Advisory Board Member.” But in reality the Center, through AJHS, has an ongoing relationship with JVP.
",-1
"The Balfour event was not AJHS’ only partnership with JVP.
",-1
"In December, the AJHS will feature “Rubble Rubble”, a play by Dan Fishback based on his trip to Israel.
",-1
"Fishback is a BDS supporter and a member of the JVP Artists Council.
",-1
"His goal is to “normalize Jewish anti-Zionism”.
",-1
"AJHS and JVP members get discounted admission.
",-1
"The venue is once again the Center for Jewish History.
",-1
"Specifically the Leo and Julia Forchheimer Auditorium at CJH.
",-1
"Leo Forchheimer’s philanthropy had left its mark on Israel.
",-1
"What would he think if he knew the anti-Israel purposes that CJH is putting his gift to?
",-1
"Efrat has claimed that, ""Zionism does not only dispossess Palestinians, but it also dispossesses in a very sophisticated way, non-white Jews.
",-1
"Being Jewish is highly identified with being white because of Zionism.""
",-1
"AJHS will claim that it is only offering different perspectives.
",-1
"But when it comes to Israel, there’s only one perspective.
",-1
"“Balfour” and “Rubble Rubble” are to be part of AJHS’ “1917: How One Year Changed the World”.
",-1
"The exhibition is supposed to cover WWI, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the Balfour Declaration.
",-1
"But the only Balfour program on the list questions whether Israel should even exist.
",-1
"The exhibition closes with Fishback’s anti-Israel agenda.
",-1
"And these are the only listed AJHS programs that focus on Israel.
",-1
"JVP is also the only organization that AJHS chooses to partner with on political events.
",-1
"The American Jewish Historical Society appears to be uninterested in holding any pro-Israel events.
",-1
"It’s uninterested in partnering with pro-Israel groups.
",-1
"Instead it’s providing a forum for a BDS hate group.
",-1
"And it’s no mystery why.
",-1
"The AJHS Academic Council is packed with anti-Israel activists.
",-1
"Lila Corwin-Berman, the chair of the AJHS Academic Council who also serves on its board of trustees, is a member of the Open Hillel Academic Council.
",-1
"Open Hillel seeks to ""open"" the campus group to BDS and other anti-Israel views.
",-1
"Berman has defended the anti-Israel hate group IfNotNow, which employs JVP tactics, and condemned efforts to fight BDS.
",-1
"She signed a petition in support of BDS activists being allowed to enter Israel.
",-1
"Other AJHS Academic Council members who signed the pro-BDS activist petition include Ari Kelman, Riv-Ellen Prell, Deborah Dash Moore, Rachel Kranson, Libby Garland and Kirsten Fermaglich.
",-1
"When we look at what is going on in CJH’s components like the AJHS, the elevation of David N. Myers to head CJH is unsurprising.
",-1
"Myers is a symptom of the problem.
",-1
"As is AJHS’s partnership with JVP.
",-1
"A great deal of shocking behavior is taking place inside Jewish organizations whose inner workings most people in the Jewish community generally pay very little attention to.
",-1
"Unlike CJH, the American Jewish Historical Society is an organization that dates back to the 19th century.
",-1

"The radical anti-Israel left will not be satisfied with embedding “moderate” opposing voices into Jewish organizations.

"But they will not be any less difficult.

"Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist
",-1
"Pope Paul VI’s 1965 encyclical on the Eucharist, “Mysterium Fidei,” was the first place I saw anyone say that the body and blood, soul and complete divinity of Christ was actually present in the consecrated species.
",-1
"Having been raised in Remi de Roo’s Victoria in the 1970s, I had naturally never heard anything at all about the Eucharist.
",-1
"The understanding that Catholics believed what they believe about it came as a bit of a shock.
",-1
"(Read the full document here. )
",-1
"Published just three months before the close of Vatican II and just as Annibale Bugnini was cranking open the floodgates of his never-ending stream of liturgical alterations, Mysterium Fidei is now an important marker of a critical turning point in Catholic history, perhaps the most important of modern times.
",-1
"Who can read this without cringing at what we now know was about to happen:
",-1
"Therefore, we earnestly hope that the restored sacred liturgy will bring forth abundant fruits of eucharistic devotion, so that the Holy Church, under this saving sign of piety, may make daily progress toward perfect unity and may invite all Christians to a unity of faith and of love, drawing them gently, thanks to the action of divine grace.
",-1
"But in 1983 at the start of my personal investigations into the Catholic religion, I knew nothing of any of that.
",-1
"The encyclical, the very first I ever read, was also a marker for me of a personal turning point.
",-1
"It was the first time I had ever seen Catholic eucharistic doctrine clearly and – most importantly – unapologetically stated.
",-1
"It came right out and said something so astounding, something so completely unlikely, that I had to admit that it left very few logical possibilities.
",-1
"Like C.S.
",-1
"Lewis’s assessment of the claims by Christ of His own divinity, this pope was either mad, bad or telling the plain truth.
",-1
"Something that may be much more noteworthy now in our current circumstances than it was the year I read it, is that the pope’s very first quote was not of scripture, but the Council of Trent:
",-1
"“At the Last Supper, on the night He was handed over, Our Lord instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice of His Body and Blood, to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until He should come, and thus entrust to the Church, His beloved spouse, the memorial of His death and resurrection: a sacrament of devotion, a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a paschal banquet in which Christ is received, the soul is filled with grace and there is given to us the pledge of future glory.”
",-1
"In these words are highlighted both the sacrifice, which pertains to the essence of the Mass which is celebrated daily, and the sacrament in which the faithful participate in Holy Communion by eating the Flesh of Christ and drinking His Blood, receiving both grace, the beginning of eternal life, and the medicine of immortality.
",-1
"I remember my thoughts upon reading this shocking statement… “By doing what?
",-1
"!”
",-1
"What could conceivably be the reason to say anything as wild as this if it weren’t true?
",-1
"The idea of transubstantiation struck me as I read that document as possibly the strangest and most earth shattering thing I’d ever heard.
",-1
"It shocked me out of a kind of swamp of intellectual worldliness; presenting the idea to my thirsty mind that there could indeed be fantastic realities far more wonderful than the banal and painfully uninteresting secularist worldview I had been taught to accept.
",-1
"It was as though someone had plausibly told me that, yes, there were fairies and magical kingdoms in real life, “just around the corner”.
",-1
"By the time I read it, I had been through a long, slow transition from a childhood devoted to Our Lady and confirmed in my belief in wonders, to a kind of disappointed practical atheism after three years in a diocesan Catholic parochial school.
",-1
"What led me to read that particular encyclical is the most clearly identifiable moment of actual grace in my young life to that point.
",-1
"It was the first time it occurred to me to investigate, like an anthropologist, what the Church herself said about her teachings.
",-1
"While mulling grimly one day over all the wickedness of the Catholic Church, I was pulled up short by a single thought: “I could be wrong.” At 17 it seemed such an unlikely thing to think I was rather shocked.
",-1
"But stopping a moment to consider, I realised that I had only ever heard about Catholic things from people who clearly hated the Church; her enemies, in short.
",-1
"It hardly seemed just to convict on the testimony of these obviously biased witnesses.
",-1
"In order to properly and thoroughly condemn the Church, with convincing due diligence, I had to read something about it that didn’t come from her enemies.
",-1
"The same day, I presented myself at the reference desk of the public library and asked, “Do you have any books about Catholicism?
",-1
"Something official?” The librarian took me to the reference section and showed me the shelves of encyclicals, documents and histories.
",-1
"Saints and popes from one end of the stacks to the other.
",-1
"Having no clear idea what my own question meant, I just picked one at random.
",-1
"The description of the Holy Eucharist as the supreme Centre from which all our life as Catholics flow, and from which all other doctrines radiated, was something that was not going to come into my head for another eight years of reading.
",-1
"But even so, Mysterium Fidei forced me to face up to a reality I’d never dreamed of before; that this, the little unassuming wafer, was the most important thing in the world.
",-1
"Reading through the encyclical again, holding it up next to the current situation in Rome, makes it easier to clarify certain critical issues.
",-1
"Given what we are now seeing, consider the poignancy of the following passages:
",-1
"When dealing with the restoration of the sacred liturgy, the Fathers of the council, by reason of their pastoral concern for the whole Church, considered it of the highest importance to exhort the faithful to participate actively with sound faith and with the utmost devotion in the celebration of this Most Holy Mystery, to offer it with the priest to God as a sacrifice for their own salvation and for that of the whole world, and to find in it spiritual nourishment.
",-1
"This was, remember, 1965, four years before the New Mass was issued and before Cardinal Ottaviani warned the pope that it was precisely this sacramental reality that was about to be catastrophically obscured.
",-1
"Who, reading this passage, does not feel the urge to shout down the years, to do something to stave off the disaster that was coming:
",-1
"[W]e are aware of the fact that, among those who deal with this Most Holy Mystery in written or spoken word, there are some who with reference either to Masses which are celebrated in private, or to the dogma of transubstantiation, or to devotion to the Eucharist, spread abroad opinions which disturb the faithful and fill their minds with no little confusion about matters of faith.
",-1
"It is as if everyone were permitted to consign to oblivion doctrine already defined by the Church, or else to interpret it in such a way as to weaken the genuine meaning of the words or the recognized force of the concepts involved.
",-1
"Keeping Cardinal Ottaviani’s Intervention directly before our thoughts, we read with a strange kind of helpless dread…
",-1
"…it is not allowable to emphasize what is called the “communal” Mass to the disparagement of Masses celebrated in private, or to exaggerate the element of sacramental sign as if the symbolism, which all certainly admit in the Eucharist, expresses fully and exhausts completely the mode of Christ’s presence in this sacrament.
",-1
"[…]
",-1
"And therefore, so that the hope aroused by the council, that a flourishing of eucharistic piety which is now pervading the whole Church, be not frustrated by this spread of false opinions, we have with apostolic authority decided to address you, venerable brothers, and to express our mind on this subject.
",-1
"[1]
",-1
"Those of us writing similar jeremiads now have been working to clarify that the attack from Rome on the moral doctrine of the Church isn’t about marriage.
",-1
"It’s about the Eucharist and to a lesser extent the priesthood.
",-1
"We know it is demonically inspired because their hatred is for Christ Himself in the first place and for anyone who loves and wants to serve Him second.
",-1
"They are men who refuse to bend the knee before the God whom they will not serve.
",-1
"This knowledge – that the attack is on the Body and Blood of Christ – can also help readers spot their friends in the crowd.
",-1
"The places where Eucharistic adoration is still offered are places where at least some flicker of the true Faith survives.
",-1
"The bishops and priests now talking about the supreme glory of the Eucharist, and the need to defend it from sacrilege, are lighthouses.
",-1
"A case in point is Bishop Mark Davies, of my own former diocese of Shrewsbury in England.
",-1
"In March, 2016, in the midst of the shouting from Rome, Bishop Davies spoke at his Chrism Mass said that only through the “reality of the Eucharist” could new vocations to the priesthood be found.
",-1
"“In treasuring this gift of priestly celibacy we need to recognize more clearly the intimate link between the Ministerial Priesthood and the reality of the Eucharist.
",-1
"It’s almost as if someone had slipped a copy of the Ottaviani Intervention inside his morning paper.
",-1
"It’s a “stitch-up” as the English call it; a fix.
",-1
"You make it a matter of “mercy” (backed up by the iron fist) that no one in a state of objective mortal sin can be refused Holy Communion; you give the national bishops conferences the power to start enforcing this, and you have created a previously unimaginable situation in the Church.
",-1
"You have created a regime in which a refusal to desecrate the sacred species will be grounds for persecution of faithful priests, seminarians and laity.
",-1
"And of course, we are seeing it starting already.
",-1
"It’s a brilliant strategy, the magic bullet that will revert the Church to the 1976 model on every front, and very likely keep it there forever.
",-1
"As if the goal was to go back in time and erase the entire John Paul II/Benedict XVI period out of history.
",-1
"It will halt the revival of eucharistic piety among seminarians; in fact, it will reverse the general reforming trend of “conservative” seminaries that was such a feature under John Paul II and has for 30 years been the hook upon which all hopes of restoration have hung.
",-1
"It is easy to see what is coming next.
",-1
"Once certain announcements are published in parish bulletins, laity will have to consider whether they can, in conscience, continue to assist at Masses where systematic sacrilege has been formally adopted as the rule.
",-1
"Not being a theologian I have no idea if this encyclical is, as so many of these seemingly orthodox documents of that period seem to be, rife with the usual “time bombs,” ambiguities, mushy language or even outright errors.
",-1
"I haven’t looked it up.
",-1
"I’m sure there are plenty of people out there qualified to examine it to see if it’s safe for Trad-Catholic consumption.
",-1
"And I have no doubt at all that there are better, more venerable, even more sublime and poignant works on the Eucharist in the canon of “official” things.
",-1
"From saints and Doctors of the Church and whatnot, many of which the pope cited.
",-1
"But whatever its flaws, Mysterium Fidei is the one I found, and I’m convinced it wasn’t an accident.
",-1
"O God, in Your infinite mercy, forgive and have mercy on Pope Paul VI Montini for whatever neglect or damage of which he may have been guilty.
",-1
"In this one case at least, a work of his was the exact right thing at the exact right time.
",-1
"For me at least it was the key that opened the Door to Narnia.

"New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”
",-1
"It should be clear by now that the entire official narrative surrounding the Las Vegas shooting that left 59 people dead and hundreds injured is falling apart.
",-1
"From shooter Paddock’s check-in date and the existence of a second person in his room, to possible connections to a terrorist organization, as well as the the actual timeline of events, everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny.
",-1
"In the last 24 hours the Sheriff’s Department has significantly revised the event timeline and a key incident involving the shooting of a Mandalay Bay security guard.
",-1
"Originally, as highlighted by The Daily Sheeple, the security guard was hailed as being responsible for preventing the shooter from continuing his massacre because he interrupted him in the middle of the attack.
",-1
"As it turns out, security guard Jesus Campos was actually shot BEFORE Paddock opened fire on the concert crowd below his 32nd floor hotel suite.
",-1
"The security guard, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman, from behind his door, shot into the hallway on the 32nd floor.
",-1
"Paddock apparently detected Campos via surveillance cameras he set up outside his hotel suite, police have said.
",-1
"Paddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time, Lombardo said, shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes.
",-1
"Police officers found Campos when they arrived on the floor.
",-1
"And Campos did not summon police to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, according to the timeline recently updated by the authorities.
",-1
"What’s also incredibly interesting, is that eyewitnesses claim to have seen security guards chasing another security guard in the minutes leading up to the massacre.
",-1
"The hotel guest in the room next to Paddock also saw “multiple gunmen.” The Full Report: The Ever-Changing Vegas Narrative: Gunman Shot Security Guard Before Massacre
",-1
"As of today, here is the revised timeline, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times:
",-1
"The new timeline has left investigators and researchers with new questions, two of which are extremely important:
",-1
"Why did shooter Stephen Paddock stop shooting?
",-1
"Paddock had already shot the security guard, waited six minutes before opening fire on the concert crowd, and then shot for a full ten minutes.
",-1
"Police didn’t arrive for two additional minutes after the shooting stopped – which is a full 18 minutes from the moment Campos was initially hit.
",-1
"Moreover, did he stop shooting because he was planning his escape from the 32nd floor?
",-1
"Or is it possible that Paddock was rushed and in a state of panic?
",-1
"According to links and information shared by Thomas Wictor and a timeline assessment by Twitter user Mr. Alex, the plausibility of Paddock accidentally killing himself amid the confusion, adrenaline and panic is quite high:

"Las Vegas Shooting Victim: “There Was 100% More Than One Shooter,” Gates To Concert Were Locked Shortly Before Attack
",-1
"Las Vegas mass shooting victim Rocky Palermo was shot in the pelvis during the horrific attack and is now speaking out about what he saw and believes happened, including the presence of multiple shooters as well as locked concert gates and police telling frantic civilians to go in the other direction.
",-1
"“I definitely do believe that there was 100% more than one shooter, every other person that I’ve talked to that did unfortunately get hit as well, have all said the same things,” Palermo detailed.
",-1
"The man then goes on to explain that after being shot he ran “about 200 yards” to hide behind a car, all the while hearing bullets fly past him at what he believes was ground level.
",-1
"“I’m waiting and all of a sudden we hear a little whizzing going by us, all of a sudden bullets are just flying by,” he continued.
",-1
"“When something is coming up and down or at least from a different angle they are either going to hit the ground or… alot of different things are going to happen.
",-1
"When someone is shooting form a horizontal line its just going to keep shooting,” Palermo attempted to explain.
",-1
"Take note that what he means here is that people were being shot at from ground level rather than the 32nd floor of the hotel.
",-1
"Palermo then specifically heard the gun shots get “closer and closer” before quickly deciding it was once again time to run.
",-1
"Shockingly, he then goes on to detail the fact that at the end of the concert the previous two nights everyone had exited a specific way but on the night of the shooting this route was locked down shortly before the attack.
",-1
"“Every other night at the concert, everybody kinda exited right off Las Vegas Blvd, that was standard, that was routine, you get out of the concert and you go down to the next casino,” he continued.
",-1
"“At 10pm they closed every exit on Las Vegas Blvd, every single one.
",-1
"They gated them all closed with chain-link fences, 10:08 the shooting started and we were pigs sitting in a corral.
",-1
"We only had one exit to go out of…..everyone was just kinda following the sheep.”
",-1
"Palermo makes clear this confused concert goers who had used the normal exits in the past.
",-1
"“The same exits we had came in and left Friday and Saturday night were definitely closed.
",-1
"There were people that went over there and tried to leave and there were cops that were telling them no, you can’t go out here, you have to go the other way,” he shockingly concluded.

"La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replied to Chris Ferrara’s articles on Fastiggi and Goldstein’s defense of Amoris Laetitia and their criticism of the Filial Correction:
",-1
"Fastiggi’s exchange with Ferrara concerning “Wait, Wait, It’s all a mistranslation!”
",-1
"Robert Fastiggi • 13 hours ago
",-1
"In the article that I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein, we would have done better to speak of the “official” Latin text rather than the “original” Latin text.
",-1
"This, though, is no longer an issue because the normative text is the Latin text published in thr AAS.
",-1
"Mr. Ferrara, however, bases his critique upon an assumption that the “generous response” offered to God is a sin.
",-1
"This, though, is not what AL is saying.
",-1
"The generous response is a move away from sin and a move toward God.
",-1
"I explain this in my most recent response to Prof. E. Christian Brugger, which can serve as my response to Mr. Ferrara:
",-1
"Posted on LifeSiteNews:
",-1
"Prof. Brugger is a good theologian and a fine man, but he still seems to believe that AL 303 implies that God is asking people to continue to sin in some cases.
",-1
"In his April 22, 2016 article in Catholic World Report, Brugger writes that AL 303 suggests that “God can be ‘asking’ someone to live in a life-state in which they are objectively violating grave matter.” Then in a Sept. 28 ‘17 LifeSiteNews article, he states that “the generous response” owed to God is “a certain state that is objectively at variance with the universal command of the Gospel.” Now Prof. Brugger argues that, because the subject remains “this conscience” in AL 303, this proves that the “generous offering owed to God” is the recognition that one is living “contrary to “the universal command of the Gospel.”
",-1
"Prof. Brugger fails to see that AL 303 clearly distinguishes between a conscience’s recognition that “a given situation is objectively at variance with the general mandate of the Gospel” and this same conscience’s subsequent recognition of a “generous response owed to God in the present circumstances.” The subject “conscience” might be the same but the object is different.
",-1
"The “generous response” is not the situation that is at variance with the command of the Gospel but an offering that God is asking amid the mass of impediments even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model.
",-1
"What might be this “generous response?” Pope Francis does not give an example in AL 303 because he’s speaking in general terms of the dynamics of conscience.
",-1
"Moreover, he knows that concrete cases vary widely.
",-1
"In our Sept. 26 article in La Stampa, Dr. Goldstein and I provided a hypothetical example of a couple in a purely civil “marriage” recognizing that God is calling them to live in continence.
",-1
"We chose this example deliberately to demonstrate that “the generous response” could be the ending of a particular sin.
",-1
"Our example was an attempt to show that Professors Brugger and Seifert are wrong to believe AL 303 implies that God is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state.
",-1
"It’s really just the opposite.
",-1
"AL 303 teaches that conscience will come to recognize that God is asking for a step in the right direction away from sin.
",-1
"In a recent interview (http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., the Italian philosopher, Rocco Buttiglione, provides this example for AL 303: “Imagine a father who has a sick son and the child improves.
",-1
"He still has fever but has stopped vomiting; the child manages to keep in his stomach what he eats and has started a therapy that seems to work.
",-1
"The father is happy.
",-1
"Is he happy about the fact that the child is sick?
",-1
"No, he is pleased that his son gives symptoms of improvement and healing.”
",-1
"This is what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303.
",-1
"God is not happy with situations that are objectively at variance with the command of the Gospel.
",-1
"God, however, is happy when people in such situations discern in conscience that He is asking them to make a choice that moves in the right direction—even if they still need to progress further toward a more complete fulfillment of His will.
",-1
"This is the law of gradualness not the gradualness of the law.
",-1
"It is sad that this beautiful and compassionate message of AL 303 has been so completely misunderstood by scholars who have failed to grasp its true meaning.
",-1
"Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 9 hours ago
",-1
"I certainly agree that the Latin text is the normative text even if it comes later.
",-1
"I certainly do not agree that the Latin text eliminates the grave problems with Amoris Laetitia.
",-1
"Rather, as I show in my article, it only intensifies them.
",-1
"What constitutes a “move away” from sin if not ceasing to commit the sin?
",-1
"No example is provided in AL because none can be.
",-1
"The notion is nonsensical.
",-1
"Just how nonsensical is demonstrated by Dr. Fastiggi’s claim that by “a move away from sin” in the case of a divorced and “remarried” couple Francis means their agreement to live in continence as brother and sister for the sake of children.
",-1
"But that would be ceasing to commit the sin of adultery altogether as it would involve abandoning the pretense that they are married along with the illicit sexual relation itself.
",-1
"Such a couple could always be absolved and receive Holy Communion under the Church’s constant practice, albeit privately to avoid scandal.
",-1
"At any rate, the “brother and sister” approach to the situation, which is that of Familiaris consortio 84, is certainly not the one advocated by Francis.
",-1
"As my article shows, Francis has made it quite clear that he approves of admitting to the sacraments divorced and “remarried” people who will continue to live as if they were married, including sexual relations, while “discerning” their situation, this “discernment” being a mere fig leaf to conceal the proposed toleration of public adultery in the Church.
",-1
"Thus, Francis thanked the Maltese bishops for their AL guidelines, which literally mandate admission to the sacraments of divorced and “remarried” people who believe themselves to be “at peace with God.” And, as he told the bishops of Buenos Aires in writing, “there is no other interpretation.”
",-1
"No amount of verbal artifice can conceal what is happening in the Church thanks to AL: Public adulterers are being admitted to Holy Communion without an amendment of life and the bimillenial discipline of the Church---which John Paul insisted involves a moral norm, not a mere ecclesiastical law, to which everyone is bound in conscience “without exception”---is being overthrown in place after place.
",-1
"It is a great disservice to the Church to maintain the pretense that there is nothing problematical about AL.
",-1
"A moral catastrophe is self-evidently underway and it is not possible honestly to deny its cause.

"Tell that to the four cardinals, the 800,000 faithful, the 45 theologians and the 61 other original signers of the correctio, all of whom you insult with your superficial and I must say entirely sophistical attempt to explain away what Francis is clearly doing.
",-1
"Fastiggi’s exchange with Ferrara concerning “More Fake News: La Stampa Tries Again.”
",-1
"Robert Fastiggi • 12 hours ago
",-1
"I would like to thank Christopher Ferrara again for calling attention to an article I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein in La Stampa.
",-1
"I give him credit for his colorful style.
",-1
"Unfortunately, Mr. Ferrara provides no real evidence for his claim that Pope Francis “wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers in 'second marriages' to the sacraments while continuing their adulterous relations.”
",-1
"In fact the statement of the Argentine bishops only speaks of the possibility of “access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist.” This could reasonably be interpreted as going to confession before receiving Holy Communion.
",-1
"The same applies to statements of Pope Francis and Cardinal Schoenborn mentioned by Ferrara.
",-1
"Pope Francis defers to the exposition of Amoris laetitia by Cardinal Schoenborn given in April 2016 when the exhortation was made public.
",-1
"Once again, Mr. Ferrara assumes this means access to Holy Communion without prior sacramental confession.
",-1
"With regard to the letter thanking the Bishops of Malta, it should be noted that Edward Pentin mentions a letter of Cardinal Baldiserri not a letter of Pope Francis.
",-1
"Moreover, this letter has not been made public so we don't know exactly what it says other than an expression of thanks.
",-1
"This seems to be very thin evidence for claiming Pope Francis wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers to the sacraments while continuing in their adulterous relations.
",-1
"As a lawyer, Ferrara should have a better sense of what really counts as evidence.
",-1
"As a Christian, he should also be mindful of the command against bearing false witness.
",-1
"Beyond these considerations, I wish to express a personal concern I have about Mr. Ferrara's standing in the Catholic Church.
",-1
"Does Mr. Ferrara believe that the Catholic Church under Pope Francis is a “Leviathan Church” and not the Catholic Church?
",-1
"If this is so, then it would suggest that Mr. Ferrara is refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff and communion with the members of the Church subject to him.
",-1
"This, though, is the very definition of schism found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2089 and the 1983 CIC canon 751.
",-1
"I hope Mr. Ferrara can clarify what he means by the “Leviathan Church” under Pope Francis.
",-1
"A more simple question to him would be this: “Are you refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff or communion with the members subject to him?”
",-1
"I apologize ahead of time if I misconstrued his words.
",-1
"I believe, though, my question is reasonable in light of his reference to a “Leviathan Church” distinct from “the dictates of the Immortal God in heaven.”
",-1
"If Dr. Fastiggi wishes to continue to pretend, despite a growing mountain of evidence, that Pope Francis has not in fact approved of the admission of public adulterers to Holy Communion--just as he did when Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and just as he did with the woman he telephoned in Argentina—then I cannot help him.
",-1
"To make it clear for him, I am contending that he and his co-author treat the Pope as if he were the absolute ruler of Hobbes’s Leviathan.
",-1
"I do not, as should be obvious, argue that this Leviathan Church actually exists.
",-1
"That it does not and cannot exist is precisely my point.
",-1
"Raising objections to a papal document because it appears to depart from sound orthodoxy is hardly “refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff,” who has not, at any rate, actually commanded anyone to “submit” to anything via AL.
",-1
"I respectfully suggest that Dr. Fastiggi’s comments evince a need for serious study and reflection before he ventures further opinions on this controversy in public.

"Security Guard Jesus Campos Shot During The Vegas Massacre Raises New Questions About Official Narrative
",-1
"The infamous security guard at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, who was allegedly shot stopping the massacre in Las Vegas over a week ago is not listed or registered as such.
",-1
"Jesus Campos, who the narrative is constantly changing around, is still a source of mystery.
",-1
"So who is Jesus Campos?
",-1
"That burning question has bothered many since the release of his name, but there’s been no photograph of this alleged hero, even though we’ve already seen crime scene images of the guns Stephen Paddock allegedly dragged up to his 32nd-floor hotel room.
",-1
"The ever-changing narrative now though, seems to swirl around this unknown mystery security guard.
",-1
"At first, Campos, a guard at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, was hailed a hero for helping guide police to gunman Stephen Paddock’s room on the 32nd floor.
",-1
"Police said Campos was shot in the leg at the end of Paddock’s assault on concertgoers—potentially distracting the gunman and causing him to panic and kill himself.
",-1
"But now, questions have been raised after Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo revised the timeline and said Campos had actually been shot about 9:59 p.m. a (full six minutes before the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m.) which means the guard could have instead led Paddock to start opening fire on the crowd for fear of being caught.
",-1
"Police have said it was difficult to identify the source of the bullets during the attack, and the confusion added more minutes to their lengthy response.
",-1
"But the revised timeline shows officers would have known where Paddock was before the mass shooting even started.
",-1
"Did Campos call 911?
",-1
"What happened during those six minutes?
",-1
"Much of Campos’s story and background remains a mystery.
",-1
"–Newsweek
",-1
"Campos’s co-worker Liliana Rodriguez started a GoFundMe account for him on October 3, explaining that he’d been shot while on “random patrol” and it could have been anyone of us.
",-1
"“Funds will be used to provide relief and financial support for him while he gets back on his feet,” Rodriguez’s online petition says.
",-1
"“This is a young man that I work with day in and day out.
",-1
"Any financial support would be appreciated for the time he would need to recover.”
",-1
"Strangely, a picture of Campos wasn’t displayed as part of the fund because Rodriguez indicated that “due to privacy from the media we do not feel comfortable publishing a photo.”
",-1
"There are obviously certain things that the FBI and other investigators seem intent on covering up.
",-1
"Their own narrative is quickly shattering.
",-1
"Las Vegas Metro Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill explained more about Campos’s actions the night of the shooting, helping fill in some of what happened ahead of the attack, but unfortunately, it only added more questions and gave little in the way of answers.
",-1
"McMahill told KNPR, a local NPR affiliate, that Campos went up to the 32nd floor to investigate a door alarm.
",-1
"While on the 32nd floor, he found that a stairwell door was jammed and radioed down to maintenance.
",-1
"Campos heard a drilling sound and thought it was odd.
",-1
"A maintenance worker came up to the 32nd floor.
",-1
"As the pair started talking, Paddock began firing through the door of his room, first with a single-fire gun and then with a rapid-fire rifle.
",-1
"Police have said that when Campos radioed what happened, it helped them track where Paddock was holed up – so why change the narrative to make it even more unbelievable?
",-1
"And still, none of this explains why Campos is not registered as a security guard either, and why the timeline is being changed publically.
",-1
"What exactly do they want us to believe?

"Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre
",-1
"During the confessional, a Canadian man by the name of Jeff detailed the fact that he and his wife were in the Bellagio Resort and Casino around 11:20pm on the night of the shooting when panic broke out in the hotels lobby.
",-1
"Jeff begins the interview by making clear his belief that there were multiple active shooters targeting different places in Las Vegas on the night of the attack.
",-1
"“First of all, I think what needs to be said is that, from my perspective, there were multiple events that occurred around Las Vegas, up and down the Strip that night.
",-1
"It wasn’t just centralized around the Mandalay Hotel,” the witness claimed.
",-1
"The eyewitness then goes on to directly say that he and his wife were involved in an active shooter situation at a different hotel that authorities have so far done everything in their power to cover-up.
",-1
"“My wife and I were in Las Vegas celebrating our 10th anniversary and on October 1st we were involved in an incident with an active shooter at the Bellagio.
",-1
"There is no mistake in my mind about it,” he continued.
",-1
"Jeff then describes a scene in which he and his wife were walking through the main lobby when screams and gunfire erupted.
",-1
"Keep in mind, this is all information that the police and the FBI has hidden from the American people.
",-1
"“All of a sudden there was just a crescendo of screams that started behind us in the lobby,” he claimed.
",-1
"“Then I heard somebody yell ‘there’s a shooter!
",-1
"There’s a shooter!’ And then I heard like five or six pops, like unmistakable gunfire, unmistakably.”
",-1
"“That was about 11:20 when we heard the shots and the screams… at that point you could hear and see the screams and see hundreds of people coming towards us.”
",-1
"Amazingly, as Shepard Ambellas noted, “The man’s claims match up to actual events captured in police audio recordings from the night of the shooting which confirms that between 11:15 and 11:18 p.m. on the night of Oct. 1 there was, in fact, something going on at the Bellagio.”
",-1
"This testimony also backs up claims by another eyewitness, Rene Downs, who has spent the past few days doing interviews about a shooter inside the Bellagio Hotel.

"Two DREAMERs Caught Smuggling Illegal Aliens
",-1
"The distinction between the illegal aliens who benefited from Obama's illegal amnesty and other illegals has always been a matter of rhetoric, not substance.
",-1
"And illegal aliens are not a racial or ethnic group.
",-1
"They're an industry: an economic industry and a political industry.
",-1
"Meanwhile DREAMERs continue violating the law.
",-1
"In more ways than one.
",-1
"Customs and Border Protection said the first smuggling attempt was broken up on Oct. 4, after Border Patrol agents stopped a car at a checkpoint on Interstate 35 and discovered two illegal immigrants from Brazil hiding in the trunk.
",-1
"The driver of the car was from Guatemala, a juvenile who had been approved by the Obama administration for a DACA permit in 2016.
",-1
"Three days later the same checkpoint snared another DACA recipient from Mexico smuggling an illegal immigrant from Mexico in his trunk.
",-1
"Neither of the Dreamers’ names were released.
",-1
"They and the illegal immigrants they were trying to smuggle are all being processed for deportation, CBP said.

"Dan Fishback: It's Okay to Boycott Israeli Plays, But Not Okay to Boycott BDS Plays
",-1
"Every time a BDS activist faces a boycott, the #BDStears come out.
",-1
"The latest outbreak of #BDStears comes from Dan Fishback and his supporters.
",-1
"Here's my article on the subject.
",-1
"Coming up in late October is “The Balfour Declaration: Support for a Jewish Homeland or Jewish State?” The two speakers are Robert Herbst, the coordinator of the Westchester chapter of JVP, and Jonathan Kuttab, who advocates a one-state solution for eliminating Israel.
",-1
"The JVP events have been canceled That includes Fishback's Rubble and Rubble.
",-1
"And Dan Fishback is flooding the media with #BDStears.

"""I have grown accustomed to feeling unwelcome in Jewish spaces,"" Dan Fishback whines.
",-1
"Him, the PLO and the KKK.
",-1
"I was raised to believe we were a people of dissent and argument.
",-1
"I was taught that it was important to ask difficult questions, and that it was noble to stand up for what you believed in.
",-1
"Anti-Israel activists like Dan Fishback are entitled to exploit Jewish spaces for their propoaganda... even while they advocate a boycott of the Jews of Israel.
",-1
"Previously Dan Fishback had authored an article arguing for boycotting some Israeli plays.
",-1
"But the only dissent and argument that Jews are supposed to welcome is that of people who hate the existence of Jewish nationhood.
",-1
"Not of Jewish nationhood itself.
",-1
"""it’s not that BDS is “censoring” work — it’s that BDS is resisting a propaganda campaign that was intentionally crafted to influence international politics,"" Dan Fishback claimed when advocating a boycott of some Israeli plays.
",-1
"It's not that boycotting Dan Fishback censors work.
",-1
"It's time for the #BDStears crowd to examine their entitlement and recognize that what's good for the goose is good for the gander.

"Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges
",-1
"Editor's Note: This is probably a reason why reporters Laura Loomer and Mike Tokes were barred from entering the presser.
",-1
"They would have posed real genuine questions of Sheriff Lombardo and forced him to stumble all over himself in answering them.
",-1
"Are they for real?
",-1
"A well-coordinated, meticulously planned attack on concertgoers leads to the murder of 58 Americans at a country music festival in Las Vegas, with over 500 injured, and they have no explanation or motive.
",-1
"Do the FBI and law enforcement think people won’t talk about it or speculate as to what happened?
",-1
"How can they possibly hold those two contradictory ideas at the same time?

"The sheriff, alluding to allegations of a conspiracy between his department, the F.B.I., and MGM — supposedly in an effort to establish a legal case — said, “there is no conspiracy.”

"October 13, 2017, Legal Insurrection
",-1
"Police and hotel still don’t agree on some details.
",-1
"I realize that in the heat of a shooting, particularly a mass shooting, it may take some time for a precise timeline to develop.
",-1
"But it didn’t take very long for the Las Vegas police to release a precise timeline.
",-1
"The initial timeline was that Stephen Paddock’s shooting stopped when, approximately 6 minutes after he started, he was interrupted by a security guard from the Mandalay Bay hotel.
",-1
"Paddock then turned his fire into the hallway, firing some 200 bullets, and after that the shooting stopped as police arrived.
",-1
"That was Version No.
",-1
"1.
",-1
"Some days later, the Las Vegas police backed away from that timeline, and stated that the security guard actually arrived 6 minutes before Paddock started shooting into the crowd 32 stories below him.
",-1
"2.
",-1
"But now that is disputed, in Version No.
",-1
"3.
",-1
"WaPo reports:
",-1
"The confusion began Monday when police said that the gunman fired at the hotel security guard, Jesus Campos, six minutes before the mass shooting began, not during the massacre as they had said.
",-1
"Lombardo also said police had hunted for the source of the gunfire and that officers responding to the gunman’s floor were unaware that a guard was shot until they arrived there, at which point the shooting rampage had ended.
",-1
"MGM Resorts pushed back on this account, first saying Tuesday that there were unspecified inaccuracies and then, on Thursday, releasing a statement directly contradicting parts of what the police had said….
",-1
"Lombardo had said Monday that Campos, the guard, was shot at 9:59 p.m. and that the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m.
",-1
"This six-minute gap relayed by Lombardo left uncertain whether there was any lag in alerting police to the source of the gunfire during critical moments.
",-1
"Police said officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m., two minutes after Paddock had stopped firing.
",-1
"MGM, though, said it was “confident” that the 9:59 p.m. time was inaccurate and “was derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have.” The company also disputed the suggestion of a lag, saying the shooting rampage began within a minute of Campos reporting his injury on the 32nd floor.
",-1
"On Friday, Lombardo effectively agreed with the company’s statement, though he argued that the 9:59 p.m. time he had offered four days earlier “wasn’t inaccurate when I provided it.” Lombardo said he was told this time had been written by someone in a security log.
",-1
"Upon investigation, Lombardo said, police learned that Campos first encountered a barricaded door on the 32nd floor at 9:59 p.m.
",-1
"The guard was eventually fired upon by Paddock “in close proximity to” 10:05 p.m., when the mass shooting began, Lombardo continued.
",-1
"Clear, right?
",-1
"Not so fast, the police and hotel still have disagreement over important details, such as when police arrived relative to Paddock’s shooting at the crowd: An enormous, important discrepancy has emerged over what happened during the Las Vegas massacre: When did police arrive on the 32nd floor where Stephen Paddock was firing his deadly fusillade onto concertgoers below?
",-1
"Las Vegas police say they didn’t get to the floor until after the shooting was over.
",-1
"But MGM Resorts International, the owner of Mandalay Bay, says police officers were there shortly after the shooting began, responding to a report of a security guard being shot.
",-1
"The discrepancy could raise questions about whether police might have taken steps to intervene while Paddock was launching his devastating 10-minute onslaught….
",-1
"… on Thursday, in response to inquiries about when Mandalay Bay notified police of the Campos shooting, MGM Resorts issued a statement that was unequivocal: Las Vegas police officers accompanied Mandalay Bay security to the Campos shooting and “immediately responded.” MGM said that “Metro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio.
",-1
"As to Paddock’s motive, still nothing from the investigation.

"Kerry On Edge As Legacy Crumbles
",-1
"President Trump insisted on significant improvements to the Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action (JCPOA), as the deal is formally known.
",-1
"The JCPOA’s fundamental flaws that President Trump wants fixed include Iran’s ability to block unfettered international inspections, the wiggle room that Iran is exploiting to continue developing and testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and the sunset clause on nuclear enrichment that would provide Iran a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state after the current restrictions are lifted.
",-1
"Obama and Kerry had promised that these issues would be dealt with satisfactorily before agreeing to the final terms of the JCPOA.
",-1
"Instead they caved to Iranian pressure in order to get the deal done.
",-1
"Moreover, all that President Trump has done so far is to return the JCPOA to Congress for review.
",-1
"Had Obama followed the Constitution and submitted the JCPOA to the Senate as a treaty in the first place, the JCPOA in its present form almost certainly would not have been approved.
",-1
"Congress should now have the opportunity to revisit the JCPOA to determine whether the protections that the Obama administration promised are working as advertised.
",-1
"Congress should also consider whether time limits on Iran’s commitments continue to make sense in light of what we are now experiencing with Iran’s nuclear technology collaborator, North Korea.
",-1
"It bought time to turn into a full-fledged nuclear power under our noses.
",-1
"Kerry had promised that the Iranian regime would be prohibited from testing ballistic missiles.
",-1
"This turned out to be a lie.
",-1
"After the JCPOA was finalized, with no such prohibition included, Iran continued to test such missiles.
",-1
"The Obama administration’s response was that the missiles had become a separate issue, to be dealt with under a new United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the JCPOA.
",-1
"The new resolution replaced clear prohibitions imposed on Iran’s ballistic missile program with a weak declaration in an annex that simply “calls upon” Iran not to undertake any activity such as development and test launches related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons for eight years.
",-1
"The commander of Iran’s Army, Major General Ataollah Salehi, had told reporters just a month before the launch of those missiles that Iran was ""neither paying any attention to the resolutions against Iran, nor implementing them.
",-1
"This is not a breach of the JCPOA.”
",-1
"Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin, spurning requests from Obama administration officials to impose sanctions against Iran under the Security Council resolution, asserted that the Iranian missile test did not violate the resolution.
",-1
"“A call is different from a ban so legally you cannot violate a call, you can comply with a call or you can ignore the call, but you cannot violate a call,” the Russian ambassador said.
",-1
"In short, the JCPOA did not cover the missile tests and the replacement UN Security Council resolution that did mention the missiles is toothless.
",-1
"Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told CNN, during an interview aired on April 6, 2015, that under the deal’s terms then still being negotiated, “you will have anywhere, anytime, 24/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has.""
",-1
"Rhodes claimed that “if we see a site that we need to inspect on a military facility, we can get access to that site and inspect it.
",-1
"“We never sought in this negotiation the capacity for so-called anytime, anywhere,” Rhodes said on July 14, 2015.
",-1
"The JCPOA’s supporters, including Kerry, have made much of the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has on several occasions verified Iran’s compliance with its commitments under the JCPOA, keeping its stock of low-enriched uranium below the limit set forth in the JCPOA and not pursuing further construction of the Arak reactor.
",-1
"Iran was found to have slightly exceeded the limit on its stock of heavy water, but has remedied the problem to the IAEA’s satisfaction.
",-1
"IAEA chief Yukiya Amano reiterated in a statement he issued on October 9th that Iran has remained in compliance with its JCPOA commitments.
",-1
"The problem, as any clear-eyed observer of the process recognizes, is that the IAEA relies on Iran for self-inspection of certain sites that the regime does not want the IAEA to inspect freely on its own.
",-1
"IAEA inspectors have avoided examining military sites it knows exists and has no reliable way of tracking undeclared sites.
",-1
"The IAEA’s explanation for not visiting any of Iran’s known military sites is that it had “no reason to ask” for access.
",-1
"Evidently, the IAEA is supposed to block out the fact that Iran had conducted tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations at a military site before the JCPOA’s finalization in 2015.
",-1
"The IAEA should just pretend that such tests could not possibly happen again.
",-1
"“Nobody is allowed to visit Iran's military sites,” said Iran’s Head of Strategic Research Center at the Expediency Council and adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, Ali Akbar Velayati.
",-1
"Intimidation works.
",-1
"The IAEA knows not to ask.
",-1
"Kerry claimed on September 2, 2015 that the JCPOA “never sunsets.
",-1
"There’s no sunset in this agreement.”
",-1
"This month Kerry has resorted to parsing words.
",-1
"He claims the phrase 'sunset provisions' is a “misnomer,” before then defending the JCPOA’s time limits.
",-1
"""We were comfortable because the cap on Iran’s low-enriched uranium stockpile remains in place until 2030,” Kerry wrote in an article published in the Washington Post late last month.
",-1
"In the meantime, Kerry advises us not to worry.
",-1
"Kerry declared, “15 or 25 years from now, we still have the same military options we have today.”
",-1
"Instead, Clinton started us down the primrose path of naïve diplomacy with a duplicitous regime that now is on the verge of being able to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear warheads delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles.
",-1
"It is precisely because North Korea’s actions over the last 23 years have proven that making concessions to a rogue regime in order to obtain denuclearization commitments is so dangerous that President Trump does not want to make the same mistake with Iran.
",-1
"America’s European allies are also upset with President Trump for refusing to recertify the deal and threatening to pull out if certain conditions are not met.
",-1
"British Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint statement last Friday praising the JCPOA and its implementation.
",-1
"They said that the nuclear deal with Iran was “the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran’s nuclear programme is not diverted for military purposes.
",-1
"Perhaps these European leaders should remember their own history.
",-1
"Appeasement through phony deals with a rogue dictatorship does not work, as proven by the infamous Munich Pact signed by British and French Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Edouard Daladier with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler seventy-nine years ago.

"Madagascar Plague Outbreak Has Already Killed 57 And Infected Over 600
",-1
"So far, the plague has claimed 57 lives and infected more than 680 others.
",-1
"These figures are from October 12, however, and the disease is spreading rapidly.
",-1
"An estimated 329 of these cases and 25 of the deaths were in the capital city of Antananarivo.
",-1
"Of the 684 cases reported as of October 12, 474 were the pneumonic plague, 156 bubonic and 1 septicemic plague.
",-1
"A further 54 were unspecified, according to the World Health Organization.
",-1
"Of Madagascar’s 114 districts, 35 have reported cases of plague, including at least 10 cities.
",-1
"Plague is caused by infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis and is typically spread through the bite of infected fleas, frequently carried by rats.
",-1
"The bacteria will eventually end up causing the often fatal plague.
",-1
"Symptoms can include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called buboes, as well as fever, chills, and coughing.
",-1
"Pneumonic plague is more virulent or damaging and is an advanced form of the disease characterized by a severe lung infection.
",-1
"The infection can be transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing.
",-1
"According to CNN, the cases were reported by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Bureau for Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) in Madagascar.
",-1
"They include probable and suspected cases as well those that have been confirmed by laboratory tests.
",-1
"And while the country experiences regular outbreaks, with an estimated 400 cases of plague each year, this time things are very different, experts warn.
",-1
"This year, health officials report the infections started much earlier than usual, and they’re occurring in new areas, including urban settings.
",-1
"They’ve also seen an unexpected number of cases of pneumonic plague, which transmits more easily from person to person.
",-1
"Early detection of the plague is key since both forms of it can be cured with antibiotics.
",-1
"But, occasionally there can be cases of septicemic plague, where the infection has spread to a person’s bloodstream and can cause bleeding and necrosis of tissue, turning it black.
",-1
"Internationally, this outbreak is also being taken seriously.
",-1
"WHO delivered more than 1.2 million doses of antibiotics and released $1.5 million in emergency funds earlier this month.
",-1
"The Red Cross has released more than $1 million to deploy a treatment center and has mobilized more than 1,000 volunteers and is upgrading their skills on community surveillance, finding and monitoring people who have been in contact with infected patients and insightful messaging to stop the spread of this disease.
",-1
"By now, we have all heard of Jesus Campos.
",-1
"He’s the heroic security guard that allegedly located the Las Vegas shooter, Steven Paddock.
",-1
"Of course, this leads many to believe that Campos didn’t even exist, to begin with.
",-1
"His mere existence appears to have been fabricated by the very authorities who are cramming lies down our throats about this massacre for the sake of political agendas.
",-1
"Once he saw Campos, Paddock reportedly fired nearly 200 rounds through his suite door, wounding Campos in the leg.
",-1
"Moments later (6 minutes actually, according to the newly revised timeline regarding Campos) Paddock allegedly opened fire on a crowd killing more than 50 and injuring nearly 500.
",-1
"But Campos has been a mysterious subject since being wounded in the first moments of Paddock’s assault.
",-1
"After speaking to hotel and law enforcement officials, Campos was scheduled to appear on local Las Vegas television for an interview but went missing just moments before he was supposed to be on the air.
",-1
"David Hickey, a spokesman for the Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America (SPFPA), Campos’s union, said he got a text that Campos had been taken to an urgent care facility, UMC Quick Care.

"“Right now I’m just concerned where my member is, and what his condition is.

"THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS OF TRUMP'S IRAN INITIATIVE
",-1
"Originally published the Jerusalem Post.
",-1
"On Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran.
",-1
"No, in his speech decertifying Iran’s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn’t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism.
",-1
"Trump’s move was not operational.
",-1
"It was directional.
",-1
"In his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran.
",-1
"Trump’s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime’s repression of its own people.
",-1
"It is notable that these remarks preceded Trump’s discussion of the nuclear deal – which was the ostensible subject of his speech.
",-1
"This was a critical point because for the past two years, US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama’s nuclear pact.
",-1
"After accomplishing that goal, Trump turned his attention to how Iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact.
",-1
"By empowering Congress to prohibit economic cooperation with Iran, Trump put the Europeans, Chinese and Russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran.
",-1
"After putting them on notice, Trump discussed the possibility of improving Obama’s nuclear accord.
",-1
"Among other things, he suggested expanding the inspection regime against Iran’s nuclear installations and canceling the so-called “sunset” clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of Iran’s nuclear advancement.
",-1
"Trump’s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major, positive shift in US policy toward Iran.
",-1
"Such a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of Trump’s goals of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies.
",-1
"Unfortunately, it is also likely, indeed, it is more likely, that his words will not be translated into policies to achieve these critical aims.
",-1
"Trump’s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to Congress for holding Iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move.
",-1
"He has a lot of enemies, and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on Capitol Hill.
",-1
"Obama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, hadn’t agreed to cast the Constitution aside and ignore Obama’s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.
",-1
"Today Corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling Trump’s agenda.
",-1
"If he wishes, out of spite, Corker can block effective sanctions from being passed.
",-1
"And he may do so even though the implications for his Senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of Iran’s nuclear program.
",-1
"What is true for Corker is doubly true for the Democrats.
",-1
"Leading Democratic senators like Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin and Chuck Schumer, who opposed Obama’s Iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the Trump administration, they are required to oppose any change to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.
",-1
"Indeed, given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give Iran a free pass for its anti-American aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House.
",-1
"Then again, by framing the issue of Iran’s threat to America as he did, and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on Iran to Congress, Trump opened up the possibility that Congress will conduct substantive – rather than personal – debates on Iran.
",-1
"And the more substantive those debates become, the further away the US discourse will move from the mendacious assumptions of Obama’s Iran policy – that the Iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential US ally, and that there is nothing inherently aggressive or problematic about Iran’s illicit nuclear weapons program.
",-1
"The second major risk inherent in Trump’s approach is that he will get his way; that the Europeans, Russians and Chinese and the Iranians will agree to improve the nuclear deal.
",-1
"The problem here is not obvious.
",-1
"Clearly, it is better if the deal is amended to delete the sunset clauses and expand the inspections regime.
",-1
"Yet even an amended, improved deal will still serve as a shield to Iran’s nuclear program.
",-1
"So long as the US continues to maintain a policy based on the false view that all that is necessary to destroy the threat of a nuclear armed Iran is a combination of the nuclear deal and economic sanctions, it will continue to ensure that Iran and its nuclear program remain a major threat.
",-1
"To understand what must be done we must return to Trump’s speech and its strategic significance.
",-1
"By taking a holistic view of the Iranian threat – grounded in a recognition of the inherent hostility of the regime – Trump opened up the possibility that the US and its allies can develop a holistic policy for confronting and defeating Iran and its proxies.
",-1
"If the Iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy, they can be helpful.
",-1
"A wider strategy would target Iran’s regional aggression by weakening its proxies and clients from Hezbollah and Hamas to the regimes in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.
",-1
"It would target the regime itself by empowering the ayatollahs’ domestic opponents.
",-1
"It would pin down Iranian forces by arming and otherwise assisting the Iraqi Kurds to defend and maintain their control over their territory along the Iranian border while strengthening the ties between Iranian Kurds and Iraqi Kurds.
",-1
"Friday, Trump created the possibility for such a strategy.
",-1
"It is up to members of Congress, and US allies like Israel and the Sunni Arab states to help Trump conceive and implement it.
",-1
"If they fail, the possibility Trump created will be lost, perhaps irrevocably.
",-1
"This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge
",-1
"The informant, who is so far only known as “Confidential Source 1,” says that when he attempted to come forward last year with information that linked the Clinton Foundation directly to the scandal he was promptly silenced by the FBI and the Obama administration.
",-1
"Working as a confidential witness, the businessman made kickback payments to the Russians with the approval of his FBI handlers and gathered other evidence, the records show.
",-1
"Sources told The Hill the informant’s work was crucial to the government’s ability to crack a multimillion dollar racketeering scheme by Russian nuclear officials on U.S. soil that involved bribery, kickbacks, money laundering and extortion.
",-1
"In the end, the main Russian executive sent to the U.S. to expand Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nuclear business, an executive of an American trucking firm and a Russian financier from New Jersey pled guilty to various crimes in a case that started in 2009 and ended in late 2015.
",-1
"Toensing added her client has had contact from multiple congressional committees seeking information about what he witnessed inside the Russian nuclear industry and has been unable to provide that information because of the NDA.
",-1
"“He can’t disclose anything that he came upon in the course of his work,” she said.
",-1
"The information the client possesses includes specific allegations that Russian executives made to him about how they facilitated the Obama administration’s 2010 approval of the Uranium One deal and sent millions of dollars in Russian nuclear funds to the U.S. to an entity assisting Bill Clinton’s foundation.
",-1
"At the time, Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of State on the government panel that approved the deal, the lawyer said.
",-1
"It has been previously reported that Bill Clinton accepted $500,000 in Russian speaking fees in 2010 and collected millions more in donations for his foundation from parties with a stake in the Uranium One deal, transactions that both the Clintons and the Obama administration denied had any influence on the approval.
",-1
"In the midst of the new discoveries revealed yesterday about the Uranium One case (see: FBI Uncovered Russian Bribery Plot Before Obama Approved Uranium One Deal, Netting Clintons Millions), “Confidential Source 1” has once again hired an attorney, Victoria Toensing, a former Reagan Justice Department official and former chief counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to get his story out.
",-1
"“All of the information about this corruption has not come out,” she said in an interview Tuesday.
",-1
"“And so my client, the same part of my client that made him go into the FBI in the first place, says, ‘This is wrong.
",-1
"What should I do about it?’”
",-1
"The undercover client witnessed “a lot of bribery going on around the U.S.” but was asked by the FBI to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) that prevents him from revealing what he knows to Congress, Toensing explained.
",-1
"They said they would bring a criminal case against him for violating an NDA,” she added.
",-1
"Emails obtained by The Hill show that a civil attorney working with the former undercover witness described the pressure the Justice Department exerted to keep the client from disclosing to a federal court what he knew last summer.
",-1
"As we pointed out last summer when Peter Schweizer first released his feature documentary Clinton Cash, the Uranium One deal at the center of this scandal is believed to have netted the Clintons and their Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations and ‘speaking fees’ from Uranium One shareholders and other Russian entities.
",-1
"Russian Purchase of US Uranium Assets in Return for $145mm in Contributions to the Clinton Foundation – Bill and Hillary Clinton assisted a Canadian financier, Frank Giustra, and his company, Uranium One, in the acquisition of uranium mining concessions in Kazakhstan and the United States.
",-1
"Subsequently, the Russian government sought to purchase Uranium One but required approval from the Obama administration given the strategic importance of the uranium assets.
",-1
"In the run-up to the approval of the deal by the State Department, nine shareholders of Uranium One just happened to make $145mm in donations to the Clinton Foundation.
",-1
"Moreover, the New Yorker confirmed that Bill Clinton received $500,000 in speaking fees from a Russian investment bank, with ties to the Kremlin, around the same time.
",-1
"Needless to say, the State Department approved the deal giving Russia ownership of 20% of U.S. uranium assets.
",-1
"Meanwhile, the ‘journalists’ over at CNN are still trying to get to the bottom of exactly who spent the $100,000 on Facebook ads…

"Iranian Aggression Intensifies
",-1
"The next day the Iranian regime warned of a ""crushing"" response if the United States were to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization.
",-1
"President Trump has called the Iranian regime’s bluff with his announcement last week that he would do just that.
",-1
"Designating the IRGC as a terrorist organization and imposing new sanctions for its aggressive actions in the region is not a restoration of the sanctions lifted by the Obama administration as part of its disastrous nuclear deal with Iran.
",-1
"If Iran insists it can do what it wants militarily in terms of missile launches, support of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, and arms transfers without violating the nuclear deal, then the United States can certainly act to curb such activities through financial pressure.
",-1
"The U.S. can impose sanctions against the Iranian regime’s principal instrument for projecting aggressive, destabilizing force outside of its borders without violating the nuclear deal.
",-1
"The Iranian regime does not see it that way, however.
",-1
"With the lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions making available billions of dollars to Iran’s leaders to further finance the IRGC’s exploits in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, the regime is furious that the Trump administration is tightening the financial screws again, even if for reasons not directly related to Iran’s compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.
",-1
"A couple of seemingly unrelated events this past week point to Iran’s positioning itself for more aggressive military actions that could place U.S. forces in harm’s way.
",-1
"On Tuesday, Major General Bagheri landed in Damascus for talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad and senior Syrian officials, including the defense minister and the chief of staff of the Syrian armed forces.
",-1
"Bagheri is quoted as saying that his visit’s purpose was to “put a joint strategy on continuing co-ordination and co-operation at the military level.” Some experts on Iran believe that Bagheri’s visit to Damascus at this time is intended to reinforce a message that Iran will continue to supply weaponry to Syria and to reinforce the presence of its terrorist proxy Hezbollah in Syria.
",-1
"This will not only serve to bolster the Assad regime, but it also will strengthen Iran's ability to follow through on its threats to the U.S. and its allies, principally Israel.
",-1
"Meanwhile, following the departure of the Kurds from Kirkuk, Iraq earlier this week, the IRGC’s operational Al Qods arm reportedly established a command center and five bases there.
",-1
"According to Debkafile, this constitutes “the first military facility Iran has ever established openly in Iraq.” The Kirkuk region holds 45 percent of Iraqi’s oil.
",-1
"The Iraqi branch of Iran’s terrorist proxy Hezbollah has vowed that once ISIS is defeated it will start killing Americans, as it has done before.
",-1
"It is against this backdrop that U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley used her entire speech to the UN Security Council on Wednesday to denounce the Iranian regime on multiple grounds.
",-1
"The session was supposed to be devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Ambassador Haley departed from the monthly ritual during which Israel is normally singled out for criticism by other Council members.
",-1
"She went after Iran instead.
",-1
"She explained why the Trump administration decided to take “a comprehensive approach to confronting the Iranian regime,” which does not give the regime a get out of jail free card even if it is in technical compliance with the loophole-ridden nuclear deal agreed to by the Obama administration.
",-1
"“We can’t talk about stability in the Middle East without talking about Iran,” Ambassador Haley said.
",-1
"The United States has now embarked on a course that attempts to address all aspects of Iran’s destructive conduct, not just one aspect.
",-1
"It’s critical that the international community do the same.
",-1
"Judging Iran by the narrow confines of the nuclear deal misses the true nature of the threat.
",-1
"To do otherwise would be foolish.”
",-1
"Ambassador Haley accused the Iranian regime of continuing to “play” the Security Council.
",-1
"“Iran hides behind its assertion of technical compliance with the nuclear deal while it brazenly violates the other limits on its behavior.
",-1
"And we have allowed them to get away with it.
",-1
"This must stop.”
",-1
"Ambassador Haley proceeded to list various violations by the Iranian regime of Security Council resolutions pertaining to the transfer of conventional weapons from Iran and the arming of terrorist groups, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah.
",-1
"“If it is wrong for North Korea to do this, why doesn’t that same mentality apply to Iran?
",-1
"“
",-1
"As for the Iran’s supposed technical compliance with its commitments under the nuclear deal itself, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the UN’s international inspectors are not able to visit Iran’s military sites.
",-1
"Past work on nuclear explosive trigger devices appears to have taken place at one or more such sites in the past.
",-1
"International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Yukiya Amano admitted last month that when it comes to the IAEA’s capacity to check whether Iran was conducting work on a nuclear explosive device, his agency’s “tools are limited.” The Iranian regime has also attempted to skirt the restrictions in the JCPOA on its procurement of materials, equipment, goods and technology related to Iran’s nuclear activities.
",-1
"U.S. intelligence had discovered North Korea’s transfer of missile parts to Iran at the very same time that Iran was negotiating the nuclear deal, in clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions then in effect.
",-1
"The Obama administration chose to look the other way.
",-1
"Iran is flush with cash, thanks to the JCPOA.
",-1
"It wants to build out its missile and nuclear enrichment capabilities.
",-1
"In addition to covert transfers of materials and technology to Iran in violation of the nuclear deal, the JCPOA may provide a loophole for Iran to exploit in outsourcing some of the development work to North Korea for hard currency, which North Korea desperately needs.
",-1
"They are a perfect match for each other.
",-1
"Proponents of the JCPOA argue that exiting the nuclear deal unless it is changed to the Trump administration’s satisfaction would undermine U.S. credibility with North Korea and thereby kill any chance of negotiations to resolve the crisis caused by North Korea's continued testing of sophisticated nuclear arms and ballistic missiles.
",-1
"""If we want to talk to North Korea now, the possible end for the nuclear deal with Iran would jeopardize the credibility of such treaties,"" Reuters quoted German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel as saying.
",-1
"Germany is one of the parties to the JCPOA.
",-1
"Other European allies have voiced similar concerns.
",-1
"So have Obama’s former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.
",-1
"This argument is absurd on its face.
",-1
"North Korea’s aggressive pursuit of nuclear weapons and of intercontinental ballistic missiles equipped with nuclear warheads proves that weak agreements full of front-loaded goodies rewarding rogue regimes for elusive promises are worthless.

"Travelers are being warned to keep their distance from areas of Madagascar affected by the bubonic plague.
",-1
"Health officials say the disease, which contributed to the deaths of more than 50 million people in Europe during the Middle Ages, has spread from rural areas to the more urban areas not usually affected.
",-1
"Officials have reported infections in 17 of the island nation’s 22 regions since the outbreak started in August.
",-1
"The hospitals have also begun implementing preventative measures with attempts to stall the spread of the bacterial infection.
",-1
"This helps cut the chain of transmission by preventing further infections through direct contact with infected corpses.
",-1
"Last week, less than 60 people had died and around 600 had been infected.
",-1
"Now, there are 911 confirmed cases in addition to the almost 100 deaths.
",-1
"While cases of bubonic plague occur in Madagascar nearly every year, the much more dangerous and deadly pneumonic plague has never been so prevalent.
",-1
"It arrived earlier than expected this year, and has become much more contagious with it being transmitted from person to person through the air.
",-1
"Pneumonic plague is the most life-threatening form of the infection caused by the manifestation of a Yersinia pestis bacterial infection.
",-1
"Death often occurs within 12-24 hours of becoming infected.
",-1
"The bubonic strain of the disease is spread through the bites of infected fleas, whereas the more contagious and deadly pneumonic type is spread through the coughing or sneezing of an infected person.

"The Kurds have no friends but the mountains, is an old lament .
",-1
"Last week, it must have been very much on Kurdish minds.
",-1
"As their U.S. allies watched, the Kurdish peshmerga fighters were run out of Kirkuk and all the territory they had captured fighting ISIS alongside the Americans.
",-1
"The Iraqi army that ran them out was trained and armed by the United States.
",-1
"The U.S. had warned the Kurds against holding the referendum on independence on Sept. 25, which carried with 92 percent.
",-1
"Iran and Turkey had warned against an independent Kurdistan that could be a magnet for Kurdish minorities in their own countries.
",-1
"But the Iraqi Kurds went ahead.
",-1
"More troubling for America is the new reality revealed by the rout of the peshmerga.
",-1
"Iraq, which George W. Bush and the neocons were going to fashion into a pro-Western democracy and American ally, appears to be as close to Iran as it is to the United States.
",-1
"After 4,500 U.S. dead, scores of thousands wounded and a trillion dollars sunk, our 15-year war in Iraq could end with a Shiite-dominated Baghdad aligned with Tehran.
",-1
"With that grim prospect in mind, Secretary Rex Tillerson said Sunday , ""Iranian militias that are in Iraq, now that the fight against ... ISIS is coming to a close ... need to go home.
",-1
"Any foreign fighters in Iraq need to go home.""
",-1
"Tillerson meant Iran's Quds Force in Iraq should go home, and the Shiite militia in Iraq should be conscripted into the army.
",-1
"But what if the Baghdad regime of Haider al-Abadi does not agree?
",-1
"What if the Quds Force does not go home to Iran and the Shiite militias that helped retake Kirkuk refuse to enlist in the Iraqi army?
",-1
"Who then enforces Tillerson's demands?
",-1
"Consider what is happening in Syria.
",-1
"The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, largely Kurdish, just annihilated ISIS in Raqqa and drove 60 miles to seize Syria's largest oil field, al-Omar, from ISIS.

"The race is now on between the SDF and Bashar Assad's army to secure the border with Iraq.
",-1
"Bottom line: The U.S. goal of crushing the ISIS caliphate is almost attained.

"Or do we leave our forces in Syria and Iraq and defy any demand from Assad to vacate his country?
",-1
"Sunday's editorial in The Washington Post, ""The Next Mideast Wars,"" raises the crucial questions now before us.
",-1
"Would President Trump be willing to fight a new war to keep Iran from consolidating its position in Iraq and Syria?
",-1
"Would the American people support such a war with U.S. troops?
",-1
"If Trump and his generals felt our vital interests could not allow Syria and Iraq to drift into the orbit of Iran, where would we find allies for such a fight?
",-1
"If we rely on the Kurds in Syria, we lose NATO ally Turkey, which regards Syria's Kurds as collaborators of the PKK in Turkey, which even the U.S. designates a terrorist organization.

"The decision as to whether this country should engage in new post-ISIS wars in the Mideast, however, may be taken out of our hands.
",-1
"Saturday, Israel launched new air strikes against gun positions in Syria in retaliation for shells fired into the Golan Heights.

"Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?
",-1
"Last Friday, President Trump made the following announcement:
",-1
"I have decided not to block release of the CIA’s remaining JFK-assassination related records except for those records that directly implicate the CIA in the assassination, which will continue to remain secret.”
",-1
"Okay, he didn’t really put it like that.
",-1
"But that’s the potential and likely import of his announcement, which actually read as follows:
",-1
"Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.” (Italics added.)
",-1
"The operative words, of course, are: “Subject to the receipt of further information….”
",-1
"What is going on here?
",-1
"Negotiations.
",-1
"The art of the deal.
",-1
"The CIA desperately does not want to show the American people its long-secret JFK-related records.
",-1
"It has asked Trump to continue keeping at least some of them secret notwithstanding the passage of more than 50 years since the Kennedy assassination.
",-1
"Under long-established custom and tradition in Washington, D.C., when someone asks someone else for a favor, the person who is in a position to grant the favor demands something in return.
",-1
"That’s where the negotiations between Trump and the CIA come into play.
",-1
"Trump wants something in return.
",-1
"We don’t know what — maybe laying off on the Russia investigation — but his announcement last Friday is obviously part of the concluding steps of such negotiations.
",-1
"Time to buy old US gold coins
",-1
"What Trump has done with his announcement is send a clear message to the CIA: “Give me what I want and I’ll give you want you want.
",-1
"Make no mistake about it: A deal is about to be made.
",-1
"The CIA will cave.
",-1
"It will end up giving Trump whatever it is he wants.
",-1
"All this will happen by this Thursday, the date set by law for release of all the JFK records that Trump has not blocked.
",-1
"Think about it: The CIA has asked the president to continue secrecy of records that are more than 50 years old or, apparently, some relating to secret correspondence between the CIA and the Assassination Records Review Board back in the 1990s.
",-1
"The CIA’s ground?
",-1
"National security?
",-1
"Really?
",-1
"The CIA says that releasing its decades-old JFK records will reveal secret “methods” of intelligence gathering.
",-1
"What, like the CIA was using typewriters instead of computers and pay telephones instead of cell phones?
",-1
"That should be big news.
",-1
"You see, the mainstream media starts with the assumption that the CIA had nothing to do with the assassination.
",-1
"Such being the case, the mainstream media, deferring to the CIA, automatically concludes that its wish to continue keeping secret has to be based on “national security” grounds rather than an attempt by the CIA to continue its cover-up of its assassination of the president.
",-1
"Let’s proceed from the opposite assumption: That the CIA, in partnership with the military and the Mafia, orchestrated the assassination by framing a former U.S. Marine who was then working for U.S. intelligence, either Navy intelligence, the CIA, or the FBI, or a combination of all three.
",-1
"Don’t forget, after all, that that’s what Oswald said.
",-1
"He said he was being framed.
",-1
"Now, let’s assume instead that Oswald was telling the truth when he said he was being framed.
",-1
"In that case, it would be imperative that the CIA and the military keep as tight a lid on their records as possible to ensure that investigators or investigative reporters would have a difficult time piercing through to the circumstantial evidence that establishes the frame-up.
",-1
"In cases of covert state-sponsored assassinations, Latin American regimes were taught, a good strategy was to blame the assassination on a communist because then they could smear anyone who challenged the official story as a communist sympathizer.
",-1
"It would also explain why the CIA was closely monitoring Oswald’s movements prior to the assassination, something else that the CIA kept secret for decades.
",-1
"They had to make certain that Oswald was not on to them and had not discovered that he was being set up for a frame-up.
",-1
"The first organization that came out with a press release advertising Oswald’s bona fides was the DRE, an anti-communist group in New Orleans with which Oswald had had contact.
",-1
"What no one knew at the time, and what the CIA intentionally kept secret for decades, was that the DRE was a CIA front organization.
",-1
"It was being generously funded by the CIA and controlled by a secret CIA agent named George Joannides, which the CIA would intentionally keep secret from the Warren Commission in the 1960s, the House Select Committee in the 1970s, and the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.
",-1
"But there was another big operation to establish Oswald’s communist bona fides before the assassination.
",-1
"It had to do with Oswald’s trip to Mexico City, where he visited the Cuban and Soviet embassies.
",-1
"Today, Oswald’s Mexico City trip, which is part of those CIA records ready to be released, is still shrouded in mystery.
",-1
"The CIA’s continued secrecy in the JFK assassination is no big surprise.
",-1
"As I wrote in my October 11 article, “Will Trump Make a Deal with the CIA on JFK Records?,” the CIA is between a rock and a hard place.
",-1
"On the other hand, it knows that by seeking continued secrecy, it’s essentially an implicit acknowledgment of guilt.
",-1
"Do the CIA’s long-secret records contain a video-taped confession?
",-1
"Of course not.
",-1
"And they don’t contain any reference to assassinating Kennedy.
",-1
"The CIA’s practice from the very beginning has been to not put any reference to a state-sponsored assassination into writing.
",-1
"But there has to be a reason why the CIA chose to keep this particular batch of records secret for more than 50 years.
",-1
"Those long-secret records undoubtedly include small bits of important circumstantial evidence that fill out even further the mosaic of a regime-change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963, the same types of regime-change operation that took place in Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Cuba in 1960-1963, Congo in 1961, and Chile in 1973, all of which the CIA steadfastly kept secret from the American people.
",-1
"In 1953, the CIA was in the process of developing a top-secret manual on assassinations, one that showed that the CIA was specializing not only in the art of assassination but also in the art of covering up its role in state-sponsored assassinations.
",-1
"Every American owes it to himself to read that manual.
",-1
"Too bad the mainstream press has never given that manual the consideration it deserves.
",-1
"If it did, it might not be so deferential to the deal that Trump and the CIA are about to make to continue the JFK assassination cover-up by continuing to keep some of the CIA’s decades-old JFK’s related assassination records secret from the American people.

"The deadly plague outbreak that has struck Madagascar’s major cities has yet to “peak” and that could make the spread of this infection into the surrounding regions more likely.
",-1
"Since there are regular flights in and out of Madagascar and this outbreak has so far, been impossible to contain, other nations are now at risk.
",-1
"Speaking from Madagascar, Christine South, head of IFRC’s (International Federation of Red Cross) emergency operations, said: “With anything like this there is a possibility that somebody could be infected and get on a plane.
",-1
"We have done preparedness support to some of the neighboring countries.” Tourists have been warned to stay out of Madagascar until doctors can get the plague under control to prevent its spread.
",-1
"The outbreak is considered a much bigger threat to the region than in previous years because it has taken on its pneumonic form.
",-1
"That means it is airborne and spread by sneezing and coughing.
",-1
"Not only that, but the plague has a very short incubation time.
",-1
"Once exposed, some people will die within 24 hours.
",-1
"“If they are traveling shorter distances and they’re still in the incubation period, and they have the pneumonic (form) then they could spread it to other places,” said Chopra.
",-1
"“We don’t want to have a situation where the disease spreads so fast it sort of gets out of control.
",-1
"Most of the cases in the past have been of the bubonic plague but if you look at this particular outbreak, 70 percent of the cases are pneumonic plague, which is the most deadly form of the disease.
",-1
"Both forms of the plague can be cured with antibiotics, but getting treatment quickly is the key to survival.

"Third-year student Noah Lew was one of 12 board members up for general assembly ratification on Monday evening following his victory as vice-president finance of the Arts Undergraduate Society.
",-1
"The ratification vote is typically a mere formality, but Monday’s was different due to Democratize Student Society of McGill University (SSMU), an organization that was established to resist the university’s ban of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement on campus.
",-1
"Democratize SSMU was able to pass a motion that required each board member to be voted upon separately under the grounds that they weren’t a fan of the names.
",-1
"When it was Lew’s turn, he was voted down, 105 to 73 with 12 abstaining, with applause following the vote.
",-1
"Two other students who had criticized BDS, Alexander Scheffel and Josephine Wright O’Manique, were also voted down.
",-1
"Democratize SSMU had targeted Lew and the other two students on the board because they had connections to the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee (CJPAC) and were involved in getting the BDS ban passed, which Democratize SSMU claimed were “conflicts of interests.”
",-1
"Somehow I don't think being a member of a Muslim student group and supporting BDS would be considered a conflict of interest.
",-1
"Lew shared the experience on Facebook.
",-1
"“I was blocked from being able to participate in my student government because I am Jewish, because I have been affiliated with Jewish organizations, and because I believe in the right to Jewish self-determination.” Lew added that the experience shows the inherent anti-Semitism in the BDS movement.

"On Monday night, three students were removed from the Board of Directors of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), McGill’s main student government.

"Indeed, according to eyewitnesses, one of the members of the mob that removed the three directors was Igor Sadikov.

"The JFK Cover-Up Continues
",-1
"While the mainstream media was announcing for the past two weeks that President Trump was going to release the CIA’s long-secret records on the JFK assassination, I took a different position.
",-1
"On Monday of this week, I predicted that Trump would make a deal with the CIA that would enable the CIA to continue its cover-up of the JFK assassination.
",-1
"(See “I Predict Trump Will Continue the CIA’s JFK Assassination Cover-Up” and “No Smoking Guns in the JFK Records?”)

"On Thursday, the day of the deadline established by law for releasing the records, Trump granted the CIA’s request for continued secrecy, on grounds of “national security,” more than 50 years after the Kennedy assassination.
",-1
"Please, don’t start calling me Nostradamus.
",-1
"On Thursday, the deadline established by law for releasing the records, the CIA undoubtedly blinked and Trump presumably got what he wanted in return for granting the CIA request for continued secrecy.

"Some mainstream media commentators are criticizing the CIA for waiting until the very last day to make its case for continued secrecy.

"JFKu2019s War with the... Douglas Horne Check Amazon for Pricing.

",-1
"Trump tweet sent on Saturday, October 21: “Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.” Trump tweet sent on Wednesday, October 25: “The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow.

"Not likely at all!

"In the negotiations, both Trump and the CIA knew that Trump was in the catbird seat.
",-1
"The Kennedy Autopsy Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.
",-1
"In the end, the CIA blinked, just as Trump knew it would.
",-1
"Trump knew that he had the CIA over a barrel.
",-1
"As I indicated in my two articles this week, the CIA was between a rock and a hard place.
",-1
"On the other hand, it could give Trump what he wanted and have to suffer the obvious inference that people would draw — that the CIA was continuing to cover up incriminatory evidence.
",-1
"What did the CIA give Trump in return for Trump’s extending the CIA’s 50-year-plus secrecy?
",-1
"We don’t know, but my hunch is that it pertains to Russia.
",-1
"Here’s my next prediction: the congressional investigations into Trump’s supposed “collusion” with Russia are about to fizzle out.
",-1
"That’s because I believe that the CIA, as part of its deal with Trump, will order its assets in Congress to cease and desist with respect to that investigation.
",-1
"In my opinion, that’s the price the CIA had to pay in return for its continued cover-up of its U.S. regime-change operation in November 1963.
",-1
"Notice something else about the deal that Trump has presumably made with the CIA: The secrecy arrangement extends only to April.
",-1
"Ostensibly, the next six months are needed to carefully review the records to determine whether the records really to relate to “national security.” Regime Change: The JFK... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.
",-1
"For more than 50 years, the CIA has known why it has wanted those particular records to be kept secret.
",-1
"During the term of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s, the CIA decided to keep these particular records secret for another 25 years.
",-1
"There are bound to be lots of CIA memoranda detailing why it was imperative to keep these particular records secret for as long as possible.
",-1
"Finally, the CIA made its request for secrecy to Trump at least several weeks ago.
",-1
"The notion that the CIA suddenly hit Trump yesterday with a new argument as to why “national security” would be threatened, after Trump had supposedly already rejected the arguments that had been presented to him, causing Trump to suddenly change his mind, is, well, laughable.
",-1
"So, why the April deadline?
",-1
"Why not extend the secrecy for another 25 years, which is undoubtedly what the CIA wanted?
",-1
"Because Trump obviously needed collateral to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the deal.
",-1
"If Trump had extended the secrecy for 25 years, he would have lost leverage to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the bargain.
",-1
"Let’s say, hypothetically, that I’m right: that the CIA agreed to use its assets in Congress to shut down the Russia investigation.
",-1
"To make certain that the CIA fulfills its part of the bargain, Trump would need the April deadline so that the threat of the records release would continue hanging over the CIA.
",-1
"If the CIA fails to fulfill its part of the bargain, Trump releases the records in April.
",-1
"If the CIA squelches the Russia investigations, Trump grants another extension of time in April.
",-1
"that constituted a grave threat to “national security,” i.e., befriending the Russians (i.e., the Soviets) and Cubans and entering into peaceful coexistence with the communist world.
",-1
"For anyone who has a mindset of conformity and deference to authority, that story makes sense because nothing is questioned or challenged.
",-1
"For anyone who has a critical, analytical, independent mindset, the official story is filled with holes.
",-1
"For example, how many communist Marines have you ever heard of?
",-1
"Why would a genuine communist join the Marines in the first place, especially since the Marines had just recently killed millions of North Korean communists?
",-1
"Why would a genuine communist join the Marines knowing that he could be called upon at any moment to go to Korea, Laos, Vietnam, Europe, or elsewhere to kill fellow communists?

"By Oct. 13 — the last time the Metropolitan Police Department or the FBI addressed the media or public — something had changed.
",-1
"The sheriff, who had been straightforward and stern, was now emotional and at times combative.
",-1
"Both he and the FBI failed to provide much new information, and at the end of the meeting, they refused to take questions.
",-1
"Since that day, the only person who has shed more light on the investigation is Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, who was shot in the leg while approaching the gunman’s room.
",-1
"His platform to share that information?
",-1
"“The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” which aired last week.
",-1
"He hasn’t made himself available to the media since.
",-1
"“It doesn’t matter,” FBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Thursday, when asked why there had been no significant updates in two weeks.
",-1
"“It’s an ongoing investigation, and unless there’s something to report, there will not be a briefing.” Calls to the national FBI office were forwarded back to Breault at the Las Vegas office.
",-1
"At least twice this week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal has asked to speak with Sheriff Joe Lombardo about the shooting investigation.
",-1
"Both times, reporters were told by Carla Alston, the Police Department’s director of communications, that the sheriff “will not be conducting interviews.” “As he has stated previously, the case is still ongoing” she said in an email Thursday.
",-1
"“Another media briefing will be held when we have new and accurate information.” When asked when that briefing would be, Alston guessed it could occur in the next two weeks.
",-1
"The Review-Journal also specifically asked about the more than 50,000 hours of overtime that Metro officers have logged since Oct. 1 on work directly related to the shooting investigation.
",-1
"“Investigators have made progress on investigative leads and in mapping out Stephen Paddock’s life for the last few years — and they’re still not done,” Alston said.
",-1
"“We still have officers dedicated to this case 24/7.” She agreed that members of the public have a right to know more, “but they have a right to accurate information and not the speculation … that has filled so many news stories the past month.” Nearly a month after the mass shooting, the gunman’s motive remains a mystery.
",-1
"More straightforward questions also remain unanswered, including whether the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay — where the gunman was staying — has surveillance cameras, and what exactly investigators collected in the gunman’s hotel room and homes.
",-1
"Authorities also have not said how long the gunman had a “do not disturb” sign on his hotel door, and whether hotel staff saw something suspicious in his room but failed to report it.
",-1
"Though authorities have described the investigation as a team effort, they have not explained what role Las Vegas police, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are playing in the case.

"At least 128 people have been killed and more than 1,300 infected by the deadlier pneumonic strain of the medieval disease.

"SO MUCH FOR MERCY & DIALOGUE: Member of Vatican International Theological Commission Sacked for Questioning Pope of Mercy & Dialogue
",-1
"The Catholic Twitterverse is alive today with criticism of the USCCB’s decision to sack Fr.
",-1
"Thomas Weinandy, the former head of their doctrinal office.
",-1
"Or at least to stop attacking them.
",-1
"In a letter made public November 1st, Fr.
",-1
"Weinandy, a former chief of staff for the U.S. Bishops’ Committee on Doctrine and a member of the Vatican’s International Theological Commission, warned Pope Francis that he has caused “chronic confusion” among the faithful and bishops.
",-1
"In an interview yesterday with John Allen’s Crux, he added, more prophetically than he had perhaps intended, “I don’t think anyone can, or should, associate my letter with the USCCB or the American bishops.
",-1
"Neither was involved in my writing the letter, and its publication will be news to them.”
",-1
"And sure enough, within hours of making his letter public, we learned that Fr.
",-1
"Of course, the Twitterverse is busy commenting on the irony: how a man expressing grave concerns that there is an atmosphere of fear of being punished for expressing grave concerns, was immediately fired.
",-1
"Political consultants often ask: how does it look?
",-1
"As though the fog of irony weren’t thick enough, in response to the outrage from Catholics, the USCCB has done what all the other members of Pope Francis’ cabal have done and started blocking critics from its Twitter account.
",-1
"Which, it must be said, only proves Fr.
",-1
"Weinandy’s point once again.
",-1
"Some of the criticism has been unusually sharp.
",-1
"Fr.
",-1
"Just as Tom Weinandy has, in effect, just said.”
",-1
"In his letter, Fr.
",-1
"Weinandy made a point of stating that he is not signatory to the Filial Correction or any other public declaration against Pope Francis’ agenda.
",-1
"In fact, a former student of his wrote to me today saying,
",-1
"“I see that Fr.
",-1
"Thomas Weinandy has been squashed.
",-1
"He was one of my professors in Patristics at Oxford and he was one of the most mild-mannered, least confrontational, kindest academics one could have hoped to meet.
",-1
"To me, the fact that he has chosen to write to express his concern about the crisis in the church and the papacy is very significant.
",-1
"He is neither a traditionalist, nor a controversialist, but a humble and straightforward Friar who is clear-thinking and entirely loyal to the Church and Her teaching.
",-1
"I would be surprised now if we were not see more of this sort of letter/exercise of conscience.
",-1
"I imagine that it’s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence.”
",-1
"When I posted it, this assessment was backed up by Joseph Shaw, the head of the UK’s Latin Mass Society and the spokesman for the Filial Correction, who wrote, “This is absolutely right.
",-1
"Not a man to seek out confrontation.”
",-1
"The Crux piece offered a succinct bullet point list of Fr.
",-1
"Weinandy’s concerns.
",-1
"He said the pope is…
",-1
"Fostering “chronic confusion.”
",-1
"“Demeaning” the importance of doctrine.
",-1
"Causing faithful Catholics to “lose confidence in their supreme shepherd.”
",-1
"Our friend Edward Pentin has reproduced the full text of the letter at the National Catholic Register which is definitely worth a read.
",-1
"Weinandy sent the letter to the pope on July 31, the Feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola.
",-1
"Like the Dubia cardinals, he said he made it public only after the pope had ignored it for months.
",-1
"Notable in his critique is its distinct pastoral flavour, his concern on the effect the situation is having on ordinary people.
",-1
"The pope, he said, seems “to censor and even mock” critics of Amoris Laetitia for their desire to interpret it in keeping with Catholic teaching, and in doing so is committing a “kind of calumny…alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry.”
",-1
"In an interview with Crux, Weinandy said he is not afraid of reprisals but “more concerned about the good that my letter might do.” The letter “expresses the concerns of many more people than just me, ordinary people who’ve come to me with their questions and apprehensions.
",-1
"I wanted them to know that I listened.”
",-1
"In fact, Fr.
",-1
"Which inevitably brings to mind other responses that have not been quite so clear, nor so pastoral.
",-1
"When Cardinal Muller was removed abruptly from his position as head of the CDF, the conservative Catholic world wailed that it was another case of a “good” prelate being got rid of.
",-1
"But his depiction by conservative writers as a beleaguered champion of Catholic orthodoxy persecuted by the regime for his faithfulness betrays a somewhat selective memory and short attention span.
",-1
"Ed Pentin has a long file of interviews and articles about Muller that clearly show his complete inability to make up his mind whose side he’s on.
",-1
"Most recently, on October 30th, Crux quoted him under the headline, “Cardinal Muller backs Pope Francis against critics of ‘Amoris Laetitia’” in which the former head of the CDF has at last climbed on board the Kasperian train on reception of Communion for unrepentant adulterers.
",-1
"Or sacrilege either, I guess.
",-1
"Or something.
",-1
"Somehow the “new evangelization” is involved in this, though it’s unclear how exactly it makes adultery and sacrilege OK. Also, it’s very important to fulfill the Sunday Mass obligation, and as everyone knows, one can’t possibly go to Mass on a Sunday without receiving Communion.
",-1
"Because of kind-heartedness.
",-1
"Anyway, the result of this is a “marriage-like relationship” about which confessors have to be very careful not to say mean things.
",-1
"Or be too “extreme”.
",-1
"Because that could be too polarizing.
",-1
"And mean.
",-1
"And anyway, sins of the flesh aren’t the worst things ever.
",-1
"There are, like, “different levels” of gravity, you know?
",-1
"And, like, it depends on the type of sin, right?
",-1
"“Spirit’s sins” like spiritual pride and avarice and stuff, are worse than “sins of the flesh,” you know?
",-1
"Which are, like, only a result of “human weakness,” right?
",-1
"Apparently the real problem with this whole thing has been that the Kasperian kerfuffle has totally been blown way, way, WAY out of proportion, and the “polarization” it has caused has been “regrettable”.
",-1
"Muller, with little backing from Pope Benedict – who appeared content to allow his CDF prefect and the Germans shout out their differences – and with outright opposition from Francis, did indeed strive to hold the line.
",-1
"The fact that Francis orchestrated the Synods to undermine him was certainly not his fault.
",-1
"And it is difficult to imagine anyone being in a worse position than he was at the time.
",-1
"But since then, Muller has demonstrated very little of his former grit, instead attempting from one day to the next to appease both sides.
",-1
"With this in mind one could be forgiven for not taking his October 30th essay too seriously.
",-1
"Perhaps one of the good effects to come from Fr.
",-1
"Weinandy’s persecution will be to demonstrate how a pastor of the Catholic Church is supposed to act.
",-1
"As my friend said, maybe “it’s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence,” assuming there are any left.

"Weinandy gave a remarkable story of how his prayer for a “sign” that he ought to write the letter was very specifically answered: “If you want me to write something, you have to give me a clear sign,” Weinandy recalls saying.
",-1
"“Tomorrow morning, I’m going to Saint Mary Major’s to pray, and then I am going to Saint John Lateran.
",-1
"After that, I’m coming back to Saint Peter’s to have lunch with a seminary friend of mine.” “During that interval, I must meet someone that I know but have not seen in a very long time, and would never expect to see in Rome at this time.
",-1
"That person cannot be from the United States, Canada or Great Britain.
",-1
"Moreover, that person has to say to me, ‘Keep up the good writing’.” Weinandy said, exactly that happened the next day, in a chance meeting with an archbishop he’d known a long time ago but not seen for over twenty years, who congratulated him for a book on the Incarnation and then said the right words, “Keep up the good writing.” “There was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something,” Weinandy said.

"There Were “Active Shooters On The Runway” Bombshell Air Traffic Control Audio From The Night Of The Las Vegas Massacre Reveals
",-1
"The audio recordings, taken from the night of the October 1st massacre that left 58 dead and over 500 injured, are further proof that multiple shooters were used throughout the area, a fact that directly contradicts the official story.
",-1
"During the air traffic control recordings, which were released by political strategist and co-founder of “The New Right” Mike Tokes, one of the dispatchers is heard telling an incoming plane that landing might not be a good idea because there were multiple active shooters on the airport property itself.
",-1
"“Shutting down might not be a good idea, there’s active shooters on the runway,” he declared.

",-1
"While there have been countless stories since the attack that raise the very real possibility that this was a false flag, one has stood out due to the fact that the person who released the information died shortly after.
",-1
"As Shepard Ambellas reported in a now viral article, “Kymberley Suchomel, who posted her eyewitness account of the Las Vegas massacre in astonishingly vivid detail to her Facebook page on Oct. 4, subsequently passed away in her home on Oct. 9 from what reports are claiming are natural causes.”
",-1
"“Shockingly, just days before her death, Suchomel posted key details about the shooting to Facebook that contradicted the official narrative which claims that Stephen Paddock was the lone gunman.”
",-1
"From dozens of eyewitness reports, including Suchomel’s, that clearly indicate the presence of multiple shooters, to the possibility of helicopters being used in the attack, the American people are clearly not being told the truth.
",-1
"It is also important to keep in mind that multiple investigative reports conducted by other alternative media outlets have actually named government officials and private companies that may be behind the attack and so far there has been no official denial from either.

"The Cunning CIA
",-1
"This shouldn’t surprise anyone, given that practically from its inception in 1947 the CIA was specializing in the arts of assassination, regime change, and cover-up.
",-1
"It came to light in 1997 as a result of a Freedom of Information request.
",-1
"That was around the time that the Assassination Records Review Board, which was overseeing the mandatory release of JFK-related assassination records of the CIA and other federal agencies that had been kept secret from the American people since 1963.
",-1
"Today, Americans can read the CIA’s assassination manual online.
",-1
"Titled “Study of Assassination,” the manual spells out various ways to assassinate people.
",-1
"Here is what the manual states in part regarding the use of firearms:
",-1
"Firearms are often used in assassination, often very ineffectively….
",-1
"Public figures or guarded officials may be killed with great reliability and some safety if a firing point can be established prior to an official occasion.
",-1
"The propaganda value of this system may be very high.
",-1
"The manual also makes it clear that the CIA was studying ways to assassinate people without being detected.
",-1
"Note the following excerpt:
",-1
"For secret assassination, either simple or chase, the contrived accident is the most effective technique.
",-1
"When successfully executed, it causes little excitement and is only casually investigated.
",-1
"It would be safe to assume that the CIA continued developing and expanding on the assassination principles enunciated in that early assassination manual.
",-1
"That’s what we would expect from an agency whose specialties included assassination.
",-1
"We can also assume that the CIA continued to refine the ways to avoid detection when assassinating someone.

"As part of the Guatemala regime-change operation, the CIA prepared a list of Guatemalan officials to be assassinated.
",-1
"While the CIA has never revealed the names of the people it targeted for assassination, there is little doubt that Arbenz, the president, was at the top of the list.
",-1
"There is something important to note: Neither Arbenz nor any other Guatemalan official had ever attacked the United States or even threatened to do so.
",-1
"So, why were they targeted for assassination?
",-1
"Because Arbenz had reached out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as John Kennedy would do ten years later.
",-1
"That’s why the CIA targeted Guatemala for regime change and why it targeted Arbenz and other Guatemalan officials for assassination.
",-1
"The CIA officials were secretly honored for protecting “national security” by removing President Arbenz from office and replacing him with a pro-U.S. military general.
",-1
"Tracy Barnes, one of the CIA officials responsible for the operation, was awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the CIA’s second-highest medal.
",-1
"The CIA’s cover-up in the JFK assassination was even more brilliant and ingenious.
",-1
"The doctors at Parkland Hospital stated that President Kennedy had a big exit-sized wound in the back of his head, which implied a shot having been fired from the front.
",-1
"At a press conference immediately after the president died, two treating physicians stated that the other wound — the one in the front of Kennedy’s neck — was an entry wound, which implied that Kennedy had been hit by another shot fired from the front.
",-1
"This necessarily meant that Kennedy had been shot from the front, not the rear, where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was situated.
",-1
"Keep in mind something important: After he was arrested, Oswald claimed his innocence.
",-1
"But he also went a step further.
",-1
"He said that he was being framed for the crime.
",-1
"The obvious question arises: Why frame an innocent man who is situated in the rear by killing the president with shots fired from the front?
",-1
"Wouldn’t it be more logical to either have the shots fired from the rear, where Oswald was, or, alternatively, place Oswald in the front, where the shots were fired?
",-1
"If Oswald is in the rear and since shots are fired from the front, that could mean only one thing: that Oswald had confederates firing from the front.
",-1
"Who would those confederates be?
",-1
"There could be only one answer: communists.
",-1
"Soviet and Cuban communists, to be more specific.
",-1
"How would we know this?
",-1
"That’s where Oswald’s trip to Mexico City right before the assassination comes into play.
",-1
"Regime Change: The JFK... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.
",-1
"Oswald traveled to Mexico City where he purportedly visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies and where he supposedly met with a premier assassin for the Soviet Union.
",-1
"Keep in mind that this was the height of the Cold War between the United States and that the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, had taken place the previous year.
",-1
"So, President Kennedy has been assassinated.
",-1
"Oswald is immediately arrested.
",-1
"What does all that mean?
",-1
"An assassination of the president by the Soviet Union and Cuba is obviously an act of war.
",-1
"Except for one thing: The communist part and the nuclear-war part were concocted.
",-1
"That was all part of the plan.
",-1
"In the early days of the Warren Commission, commission chairman Earl Warren called a top-secret meeting of the commission.
",-1
"Its purpose was to discuss information that Warren had received that Oswald was actually a U.S. intelligence agent or an informant for the FBI or both.
",-1
"How did Warren resolve this troubling issue?
",-1
"He simply asked the heads of the CIA and FBI whether it was true.
",-1
"They said no.
",-1
"That was the end of the matter.
",-1
"He ordered all notes and other written references to be destroyed.
",-1
"He also ordered the court reporter to destroy her notes of the meeting.
",-1
"Unbeknownst to him, the court reporter inadvertently kept a recording of the meeting that ultimately came to light.

"BELIN: Well, now, the final area of my interrogation relates to charges that the CIA was in some way conspiratorially involved with the assassination of President Kennedy.

",-1
"Shapira points out, “Several news organizations, including The Washington Post, seized on the truncated file as an example of the government’s continued secrecy about the assassination.” Shapira points out that Helms’ full deposition has been in the public arena since 1994.
",-1
"(The year 1994 was during the tenure of the Assassination Records Review Board, the agency charged with securing the mandated release of JFK assassination records from the CIA and other federal agencies.
",-1
"The ARRB Had been formed after Americans had learned of the official secrecy after watching Oliver Stone’s movie JFK, which posited that the JFK assassination was a U.S. regime-change operation, no different in principle from the one the CIA had carried out in Guatemala nine years before.)
",-1
"Shapira then proceeds to provide the answer that Helms gave, which, as he points out, has been public:
",-1
"HELMS: Mr. Belin, this question, and I think you may recall this, was raised at the time and the Agency was never able to find any evidence whatsoever, and we really searched that it had any contact with Lee Harvey Oswald.
",-1
"As far as the FBI was concerned, my recollection is not all that precise.
",-1
"I believe that Mr. Hoover testified that he had not been an agent of theirs either.
",-1
"He was certainly not an agent of the CIA.
",-1
"He was certainly never used by the CIA.
",-1
"Whether any CIA officer ever talked to him any place or not I don’t know but I certainly felt quite comfortable — I believe Mr. [John] McCone [a previous CIA director] was asked to testify before the Commission on this point.
",-1
"I believe he was asked to testify.
",-1
"It was a hot item anyway at the time.
",-1
"And my recollection is that I informed Mr. McCone that we could find no evidence that Oswald had any connection with the CIA.
",-1
"Shapira ends his article by suggesting that commentators should do more complete research, maybe even use Google, before they jump to conclusions.
",-1
"Perjury.
",-1
"He left out that former CIA Director Richard Helms was a perjurer.
",-1
"A liar.
",-1
"A CIA official who would tell falsehoods, even under oath, whenever he felt that “national security” required it.
",-1
"The reason?
",-1
"Allende was reaching out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as Arbenz had done and just as Kennedy had done.
",-1
"It has no value at all.
",-1
"How often have you ever heard of a U.S. Marine communist?
",-1
"If Oswald was a genuine communist, why would he have joined the Marines in the 1950s, given that the Marines hated communists and had just helped kill millions of them in the Korean War?
",-1
"Why would a genuine communist want to join an organization in which he could be ordered, on a moment’s notice, to return to Korea or be sent to Vietnam, Laos, China, the Soviet Union, or Europe to kill communists?
",-1
"Don’t forget: this is the height of the Cold War!
",-1
"Why wouldn’t they indict him or at least haul him before a federal grand jury to testify as to what secrets he gave the Russians?
",-1
"How is it possible that Oswald could learn fluent Russian while serving in the U.S. military without having U.S. military tutors teaching him?
",-1
"We can assume that any frame-up by the CIA is going to be good.
",-1
"The operation is going to be carefully planned and executed.
",-1
"Things are inevitably going to go wrong.
",-1
"The pieces aren’t going to fit together perfectly.
",-1
"The Mexico City operation is a good example of that.

"But here’s another example, a small but important one: Recall that Oswald supposedly hid the rifle before he headed down the steps from the sixth floor of the school book depository.
",-1
"Ask yourself: If someone has just assassinated the president of the United States, is he really going to take the time to hide the rifle?
",-1
"What good would that do?
",-1
"Wouldn’t officials conduct a thorough search of the area?
",-1
"Wouldn’t an assassin instead simply leave the rifle there and get out of there as soon as he could?
",-1
"Then why the hidden rifle?
",-1
"Because it’s consistent with a frame-up.
",-1
"The framers had to hide the rifle in advance in a place where no one CIA & JFK: The Secret ... Jefferson Morley Check Amazon for Pricing.
",-1
"would see it during the morning of the assassination, which took place after noon.
",-1
"No matter how good a frame-up was, the CIA knew that it could be detected with an aggressive investigation.
",-1
"They had to figure out a way to shut down the investigation so that the frame-up would remain intact.
",-1
"The idea was that since an investigation would lead to Oswald’s supposed communist confederates in the front, which in turn would lead to nuclear war, the investigation had to be shut down immediately, especially since it was the CIA itself that had started the assassination game by repeatedly attempting, in partnership with the Mafia, to assassinate Castro.
",-1
"As soon as Oswald is assassinated, the FBI orders Wade to turn over all his investigative files to the FBI.
",-1
"At the same time, Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and FBI Head J. Edgar Hoover both write secret memos and reports saying any further investigation must stop immediately.
",-1
"Johnson appoints former CIA Director Allan Dulles, who Kennedy had fired as a result of the CIA’s regime-change operation at the Bay of Pigs, to the Warren Commission, thereby guaranteeing that there will be no investigation of the CIA.

"Then keep all the records secret for decades, when many people won’t care anymore who killed President Kennedy.
",-1
"And employ Operation Mockingbird-like journalistic assets in the private sector to flood the market with alternative “conspiracy theories” to confound and confuse the public.

"And smear anyone who questions the official narrative as a “communist sympathizer” or a “conspiracy theorist.”

"An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University
",-1
"At the end of his second year, Noah Lew, who is currently third year undergraduate student at McGill University, applied to serve as Director of the School’s student society.
",-1
"This is the atmosphere that Jewish students and supporters of Israel must endure on a daily basis at McGill.
",-1
"Lew followed the advice and was elected as a board member.
",-1
"His “secret” was intact.
",-1
"Finally, in June 2016, SSMU’s Judicial Board ruled that the BDS campaign and efforts to institute it at McGill ran counter to the McGill’s undergraduate student union constitution.
",-1
"The Board’s ruling, which is called a “reference,” was then referred to SSMU’s directors for ratification.
",-1
"Campus BDS groups held several meetings to formulate a response and founded the so-called “Democratize SSMU” movement.
",-1
"Its raison d'être was to seek the removal of Jewish and anti-BDS students from SSMU’s Board of Directors and place BDS back on the agenda.
",-1
"As an aside, one of the more vocal proponents of BDS at McGill is a rancid character named Igor Sadikov, who in February posted a comment on twitter advocating violence against “Zionists.” As a result, he was forced to resign his position as an SSMU director but dodged an impeachment effort to have him stripped of his position at McGill’s Arts Undergraduate Society.
",-1
"McGill’s BDS Action Network actively campaigned against Lew and two other board members because of their links to Jewish groups and anti-BDS stances.
",-1
"In October, SSMU’s General Assembly moved to ratify the 12-member Board of Directors.
",-1
"According to Lew, “historically, the Board of Directors had been ratified as a bloc, all 12 at a time.” But BDS activists who showed up for the General Assembly ratification forced the voting to occur on an individual basis rather than a block as was the accepted protocol.
",-1
"In this manner, BDS/ Democratize SSMU activists managed to pick off their opponents one at a time.
",-1
"But this time, they may have gone too far.
",-1
"BDS activists generally avoid reference to “Jews” by name because it is impolitic and commonly substitute “Zionists” for Jews even though most of us are cognizant of their true intentions.
",-1
"Even SSMU president, Muna Tojiboeva, voiced support for Lew and expressed the belief that antisemitism played a key role in the ousting the three board members.

"One can only hope that Fortier takes the issue seriously and conducts a proper investigation, which leads to disciplinary action.

"New Audio From The Night Of The Las Vegas Massacre Reveals That There Was “Another Active Shooter” In The Bar At The Top Of The Mandalay Bay Hotel During The Attack
",-1
"Newly released audio from the Clark County Fire Department has provided even more proof that there were multiple shooters during The Las Vegas Massacre, further debunking the official narrative of a lone gunman on the 32nd floor and once again calling into question almost every aspect of what actually happened during the worst mass shooting in American history.
",-1
"The audio, released on the SoundCloud account of a local news reporter, is an almost three hour recording of transmissions between dispatch and units on the ground amid the confusion of the mass shooting that at one point details a report that a wife of a firefighter was actually pinned down in the Foundation Room bar on top of the Mandalay Hotel.
",-1
"Intellihub’s Shepard Ambellas, who has extensively reported on the entire Vegas cover-up since the beginning, recently found that at around the 1:27:54 mark of the audio file you can clearly hear dispatch describing the situation to first responders who are headed in that direction.
",-1
"“We have a firefighter’s wife at this event who is pinned down behind the bar at Mandalay Bay.
",-1
"We are trying to get further on the name,” dispatch frantically notes.
",-1
"“Batallion 6, be advised that we are getting reports on Mandalay Bay, at the bar, we currently have, another active shooter up there.”
",-1
"After being asked to confirm the information, dispatch goes on to make clear that she is specifically speaking about the bar at the top of the hotel rather than anywhere near the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock supposedly operated from.
",-1
"“The only information I have is it’s the bar on top of the Mandalay Bay,” dispatch continues before being asked if the shooter was pinned down or “just sheltering right now?”
",-1
"Interestingly, the story doesn’t end there, as Ambellas wrote in his piece, author and entrepreneur Grant Cardone was actually holding an investors meeting in the very same bar shortly before the attack took place.
",-1
"The popular social media influencer apparently left the Foundation Room literally seven minutes before authorities claim Paddock opened fire from his 32nd floor room.
",-1
"Cardone wrote about his experience in a post on Medium in which he claimed that the Mandalay Bay was telling visitors that there was at least one active shooter, “moving” throughout the hotel shooting people.
",-1
"It was reported by the Mandalay there was a shooter moving through the hotel.
",-1
"I told Elena and Johnny, “stay close to me, we are not running out, stay calm, there is one person in charge — where I go, you follow, no matter what.” […] About this time, there was starting to be a lot more activity through the casino and now the reports suggested there was active multiple terrorists moving through the hotel shooting guest.
",-1
"Then twitter started showing up with feeds suggesting multiple hotels being attacked, bomb threats, and more.
",-1
"This new report documenting yet another instance of a possible second shooter comes on the heels of dozens of similar reports, with the most recent arriving in the form of air traffic control audio that directly stated that there were active shooters on the runway.
",-1
"“During the air traffic control recordings, which were released by political strategist and co-founder of “The New Right” Mike Tokes, one of the dispatchers is heard telling an incoming plane that landing might not be a good idea because there were multiple active shooters on the airport property itself,” SHTFplan reported.
",-1
"Slowly but surely we are beginning to see the truth about the horrific attack come to light despite authorities desperately trying to prevent it from reaching the American people.
",-1
"Sadly, the picture emerging is one that includes a shocking amount of evidence pointing towards a classic deep state false flag operation.

"The disease is known as the Marburg virus.
",-1
"It is similar to the Ebola virus and can be fatal in up to 88% of cases.
",-1
"The outbreak of the contagious and deadly Marburg virus disease in the Kween district of eastern Uganda was declared by the nation’s Ministry of Health back on October 19.

"Marburg virus disease (MVD), which causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever, ranks among the most virulent pathogens known to infect humans, according to the World Health Organization.

"The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids, and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g.

"monkeys and fruit bats).” MVD also falls within the same family as the Ebola virus – the hemorrhagic fever that decimated West Africa and killed around 11,000 in 2014 and 2015.

"The outbreak is thought to have begun in September when a man in his 30s, who worked as a game hunter and lived near a cave with a heavy presence of bats, was admitted to a local health center with a high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.

"The man’s condition deteriorated quickly and he failed to respond to antimalarial treatments.

"He died after being taken to another hospital, and a short time later, his sister in her 50’s also died of the same ailment.

"Emergency screening has begun at the Kenya-Uganda border in Turkana after all three members of the same family died of the disease in Uganda.

"﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate
",-1
"The former head of the theological secretariat of the U.S. Bishop’s conference, Fr.
",-1
"Weinandy has taught at both Oxford and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.
",-1
"None other than Francis appointed Fr.
",-1
"Weinandy to the International Theological Commission and awarded him the Pro Pontifice et Ecclesiae medal, the ecclesial equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, for his work on behalf of the Pope and the Church.
",-1
"One of the world’s most renowned theologians, Fr.
",-1
"Weinandy is a “man of the Council” and a prominent figure of the post-conciliar mainstream.
",-1
"Yet Fr.
",-1
"The key passages (paragraph breaks added) rebuke Francis for his recklessness, his deliberate ambiguity, his fomenting of error, his sowing of disunity, his unheard-of calumnies of the faithful, and even his reduction of the faith to an ideology—precisely the wrong of which he accuses orthodox Catholics:
",-1
"This fosters within the faithful a growing unease ….
",-1
"In ""Amoris Laetitia,"" your guidance at times seems intentionally ambiguous, thus inviting both a traditional interpretation of Catholic teaching on marriage and divorce as well as one that might imply a change in that teaching….
",-1
"The Holy Spirit is given to the Church, and particularly to yourself, to dispel error, not to foster it.
",-1
"This kind of calumny is alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry….
",-1
"Such behavior gives the impression that your views cannotsurvive theological scrutiny, and so must be sustained by “ad hominem” arguments.
",-1
"[T]oo often your manner seems to demean the importance of Church doctrine.
",-1
"Again and again you portray doctrine as dead and bookish, and far from the pastoral concerns of everyday life.
",-1
"Your critics have been accused, in your own words, of making doctrine an ideology.
",-1
"But it is precisely Christian doctrine… that frees people from worldly ideologies and assures that they are actually preaching and teaching the authentic, life-giving Gospel.
",-1
"Those who devalue the doctrines of the Church [i.e., Francis!]
",-1
"separate themselves from Jesus, the author of truth… What they [i.e., Francis] then possess, and can only possess, is an ideology – one that conforms to the world of sin and death.
",-1
"[F]aithful Catholics can only be disconcerted by your choice of some bishops, men who seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief but who support and even defend them.
",-1
"What scandalizes believers, and even some fellow bishops, is not only your having appointed such men to be shepherds of the Church, but that you also seem silent in the face of their teaching and pastoral practice….
",-1
"As a result, many of the faithful, who embody the ""sensus fidelium,"" are losing confidence in their supreme shepherd.
",-1
"[T]he Church is one body, the Mystical Body of Christ, and you are commissioned by the Lord himself to promote and strengthen her unity.
",-1
"But your actions and words too often seem intent on doing the opposite….
",-1
"You have often spoken about the need for transparency within the Church.
",-1
"You have frequently encouraged… all persons, especially bishops, to speak their mind and not be fearful of what the pope may think.
",-1
"But… what many [bishops] have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it… Many fear that if they speak their mind, they will be marginalized or worse.
",-1
"I have often asked myself: ""Why has Jesus let all of this happen?""
",-1
"Ironically, your pontificate has given those who hold harmful theological and pastoral views the license and confidence to come into the light and expose their previously hidden darkness….

"Father Weinandy reveals that he decided to publicize this historic missive only after receiving an unmistakable sign from heaven.
",-1
"As he recounts here, after repeatedly “beseeching Jesus and Mary, St. Peter and all of the saintly popes who are buried there to do something to rectify the confusion and turmoil within the Church today, a chaos and an uncertainty that I felt Pope Francis had himself caused,” he asked for a minutely specific sign from heaven on whether he should write the letter: that the next day he would meet someone he had not seen in a very long time, would never expect to see in Rome, and was not from the United States, Canada or Great Britain, which person would utter the particular phrase: “Keep up the good writing.”
",-1
"At lunch the next day, the sign was given.
",-1
"An old friend he had not seen in more than twenty years and would never have expected to meet in Rome, who is now an archbishop, appeared suddenly from between two parked cars, renewed acquaintances and, referring to one of Father Weinandy’s books, said: “Keep up the good writing.”
",-1
"Writes Fr.
",-1
"Weinandy: “I could hardly believe that this just happened in a matter of a few minutes.
",-1
"But there was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something.
",-1
"I also think it significant that it was an Archbishop that Jesus used.

"As if to confirm the validity of his own indictment of this pontificate, only a day after this letter was published, the USCCB demanded that Fr.
",-1
"Weinandy resign his current position as a consultant to the U.S. bishops.
",-1
"He has done so.
",-1
"Fessio’s Catholic World Report, another voice of the rising mainstream opposition to Francis, notes that “In making such a request, the USCCB, it would appear, reinforces Fr.
",-1
"Weinandy’s very point about fearfulness and lack of transparency.”
",-1
"Weinandy’s intervention gives us hope that the plan to remake the Church according to the mind of Bergoglio will ultimately encounter a resistance that will bring an end to the Latin American-style dictatorship Francis has imposed upon the Church, even as he speaks of dialogue, collegiality, decentralization and parreshia (but only for those who agree with him).
",-1
"The plan that ultimately must fail may well fail even while Francis is attempting to carry it out.

"Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?
",-1
"Traditionalists are often derided by neo-Catholic commentators for relying on supposedly apocryphal quotations from Popes or saints bearing on the current ecclesial crisis.
",-1
"But these critics never demonstrate that the oft-cited quotations are apocryphal; they merely assert that they must be, as they seem too probative to be true.
",-1
"This is often done in comment boxes or responses to online queries at neo-Catholic websites, wherein the neo-Catholic commentator professes he can find no source for a given quotation—meaning he hasn’t bothered to do any serious investigation beyond a few Google searches.
",-1
"Take this quotation of Pius XII, for example, speaking in 1931 when he was still Monsignor Pacelli, serving as Pius XI’s Secretary of State:
",-1
"I am worried by the Blessed Virgin’s messages to Lucy of Fatima.
",-1
"This persistence of Mary about the dangers which menace the Church is a divine warning against the suicide that would be represented by the alteration of the faith, in her liturgy, her theology and her soul….
",-1
"I hear all around me innovators who wish to dismantle the Sacred Chapel, destroy the universal flame of the Church, reject her ornaments and make her feel remorse for her historical past.
",-1
"A day will come when the civilized world will deny its God, when the Church will doubt as Peter doubted.
",-1
"She will be tempted to believe that man has become God.
",-1
"In our churches, Christians will search in vain for the red lamp where God awaits them.
",-1
"Like Mary Magdalene, weeping before the empty tomb, they will ask, “Where have they taken Him?”
",-1
"When I first cited this quotation some 17 years ago, I was contacted by a very prominent neo-Catholic luminary who demanded a source for it, because he and his friends believed it was “apocryphal.” I did not receive the courtesy of a thank-you when I pointed him to pp.

"“There will be such diversity of opinions and schisms among the people, the religious and the clergy, that, except those days were shortened, according to the words of the Gospel, even the elect would be led into error, were they not specially guided, amid such great confusion, by the immense mercy of God….

"Saint Francis’ prophecy is clearly not a prediction of the Great Western Schism (1378-1417), which did not involve a “destroyer” on the Chair of Peter who leads the faithful into error, widespread apostasy, and the persecution of faithful Catholics as “schismatics.” But it does contain elements very familiar to us today.
",-1
"Something else to consider: Saint Francis, one of the greatest saints in Church history, one of the few who is known and revered by the whole world, freely revealed his vision of an ecclesial destroyer who usurps the papal office.
",-1
"That is, Saint Francis did not suffer from the currently reigning papolatry, which holds that the indefectibility of the Church depends upon defending every word and deed of a given Pope as somehow consistent with Tradition and declares absolutely inadmissible the idea that the holder of the Petrine office could be a threat to the integrity of the Faith.
",-1
"Rather, Saint Francis, illuminated by heaven itself, recognized the coming reality of what Saint Robert Bellarmine, a Doctor of the Church, hypothesized as possible in principle, to cite another “apocryphal” quotation:
",-1
"Just as it is licit to resist the Pontiff that aggresses the body, it is also licit to resist the one who aggresses souls or who disturbs civil order, or, above all, who attempts to destroy the Church.

"Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack
",-1
"Newly released footage of the Las Vegas Massacre, captured by a private surveillance camera and recently released by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, has once again ignited the theory that helicopters were used during the horrific attack.
",-1
"Over the last month multiple videos have been released that many believe show helicopters either conducting an attack on the Vegas Strip or attempting to stop those that were and now, with this latest evidence release, that possibility seems all the more plausible.
",-1
"As Shepard Ambellas reported for Intellihub, “The [footage] is presumed to have been captured by a nearby business’s southward facing security camera which is located approximately 780 feet due east of the venue where the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival was held on Oct. 1.
",-1
"The tape was given to Fox News by an attorney who represents several shooting victims.”
",-1
"“Astonishingly, between the times of 10:13 and 10:16 a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera,” Ambellas continued.
",-1
"“By 10:14 much larger crowds of people can be seen streaming through the area to escape the massacre going on,” Carlson reported.
",-1
"“You can see a large amount of wind and debris, apparently that is due to a helicopter hovering overhead.”
",-1
"The footage goes how to show two men attempt to help a victim who had apparently been shot, eventually resorting to covering up the body after they realized it was simply too late.
",-1
"Ambellas also reported on what his research indicates were documented helicopters in the air at the time.
",-1
"A quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m., several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen.
",-1
"However, the departure of the choppers and the fact that several of them overflew the parking lot does not explain all of the debris being kicked up from by a heavy downdraft, prop wash, possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer.
",-1
"In fact, the downdraft appears to be constant from 10:13-10:16 p.m. and not intermittent as if several choppers had just passed overhead.

"As I have reported in the past, multiple other videos taken on the night of the attack also seem to point to helicopters being used throughout the city.

"The death toll in Madagascar due to the plague has jumped for the first time since health officials claimed the infection was in the beginning stages of control.
",-1
"With the new uptick in those who died, the fear that the disease will spread to the United Kingdom has been confirmed as “100 percent likely.”
",-1
"The plague death toll has now shown signs that it’s picking up speed again.
",-1
"At least 2,034 people have been infected down by a more lethal form of the black death so far in the country, which lies off the coast of Africa, according to WHO statistics.
",-1
"The plague spreads easily and can kill within 48 hours.
",-1
"According to the Daily Mail, experts warn the outbreak of plague in Madagascar this year is being fueled by a strain more lethal than the one which usually strikes the country.
",-1
"This form of the pneumonic plague is airborne, easily spread by a cough or a sneeze, and has been responsible for two-thirds of all infections this year.
",-1
"But with over 2000 alread infected by pneumonic plague (and counting) health officials aren’t willing to quit sounding alarms just yet.
",-1
"Paul Hunter, a professor of health protection at the world-renowned University of East Anglia, was the first expert to predict the plague could travel across the sea.
",-1
"He previously said: “The big anxiety is it could spread to mainland Africa, it’s not probable, but certainly possible, that might then be difficult to control.
",-1
"“We don’t want a situation where the disease spreads so fast it gets out of control.
",-1
"We are talking about it spreading in days rather than weeks.” But Hunter is adamant that a well-developed country could manage the plague should a global outbreak occur.
",-1
"Hopefully, most will never have to find out how well another country can manage this infection.
",-1
"“I believe that it’s 100 percent likely that plague will arrive in the UK once more – it’s just a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’.
",-1
"“With the current outbreak still remaining treatable with antibiotics, however, the current risk is low.”

"House of Representatives Paid $15,000,000 To Sexual Harassment Victims
",-1
"Did you know that the House of Representatives has paid out $15,000,000 to victims of sexual harassment in recent years?
",-1
"In recent days, CNN has interviewed dozens of people that worked on Capitol Hill, and almost every single one of them had stories of sexual harassment to share…
",-1
"CNN spoke with more than 50 lawmakers, current and former Hill aides and political veterans who have worked in Congress, the majority of whom spoke anonymously to be candid and avoid potential repercussions.
",-1
"With few exceptions, every person said they have personally experienced sexual harassment on the Hill or know of others who have.
",-1
"The American people are not going to put up with this any longer.
",-1
"We have no choice but to clean up our government because the rest of the world is laughing at us.
",-1
"On Tuesday, U.S. Representative Jackie Speier told a congressional hearing that she personally knows of two current members of Congress that have “engaged in sexual harassment”…
",-1
"They want the system fixed and the perpetrators held accountable.”
",-1
"And Speier was the one that revealed the fact that 15 million dollars have been paid out to victims of sexual harassment in the House in recent years.
",-1
"The following comes from Breitbart…
",-1
"Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press Daily on Tuesday that the U.S. House of Representatives has paid $15 million to alleged victims of sexual harassment by its own members in recent years.
",-1
"“We do know there is about $15 million that has been paid out by the House on behalf of harassers in the last ten to 15 years,” she said.
",-1
"“15 million dollars has been paid out over sexual harassment claims,” Todd replied, somewhat shocked.
",-1
"“So, obviously more than one member of Congress.”
",-1
"If members of Congress are engaged in this type of behavior, why don’t the American people know about it?
",-1
"And why are those members of Congress still allowed to serve?
",-1
"Representative Barbara Comstock also testified on Tuesday.
",-1
"Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) said at a House Administration Committee hearing on Tuesday that a sitting member of the U.S. Congress exposed himself to a young female staffer who delivered papers to his house–at his request.
",-1
"We need to be told who this member of Congress is so that he can be removed from Congress immediately.
",-1
"This kind of behavior is not acceptable for anyone in a civilized society – and that goes double for someone that is supposed to be one of the leaders of our nation.
",-1
"Here are the exact words that Comstock used as she described this incident…
",-1
"This member asked a staffer to bring them over some materials, to their residence.
",-1
"And the young staffer — it was a young woman — went there and was greeted with a member in a towel.
",-1
"It was a male, who then invited her in.
",-1
"And at that point, he decided to expose himself.
",-1
"She left, and then she quit her job.
",-1
"Of course, this sort of behavior is not just limited to members of Congress.
",-1
"In fact, things were so bad that at one point a Secret Service agent almost got into a fight with Biden.
",-1
"Here is more from Paul Joseph Watson…
",-1
"During one alleged incident in 2009, Biden cupped the breast of a Secret Service agent’s girlfriend during a photo, prompting the agent to shove Biden and almost hit him.
",-1
"The agent was subsequently suspended for a week, according to the source.
",-1
"Men would often stand in front of female agents and Navy women or create false pretenses to have them leave the room just to get them away from Biden, according to the agent.
",-1
"When I am elected to Congress, I am going to make fighting this sort of predatory behavior a top priority.
",-1
"Those that have been engaging in this sort of shameful behavior have got to go because we simply are not going to put up with it anymore.

"Once the bacteria is resistant, the Madagascar healthcare system will be overwhelmed, and the disease will have control of the nation.

"Scores of doctors and nurses have been struck down with the disease, which is predicted to gather momentum in the coming weeks and there are growing fears hospitals will be unable to meet the illness’ burden.

",-1
"The following comes from an article in which Tweeden shared her story…
",-1
"I couldn’t believe it.

"I told my husband everything that happened and showed him the picture.
",-1
"But that was then, this is now.
",-1
"I’m no longer afraid.
",-1
"When the story initially broke, Franken rushed to issue an apology…
",-1
"“I certainly don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,” said Franken.
",-1
"“As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn’t.
",-1
"I shouldn’t have done it.”
",-1
"Guy Cecil, the former head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and now the boss of a leading Democratic super PAC, voiced his frustration with the inadequacy of Franken’s apology on Twitter.
",-1
"“That was not an apology and was an insufficient response to serious allegations,” Cecil tweeted.
",-1
"And of course, since we are talking about Al Franken, it wasn’t exactly difficult to find material.
",-1
"Amid the emergence of a 2006 photo of Al Franken groping journalist and talk radio anchor Leeann Tweeden, a photo of the embattled Minnesota Senator appearing to grab comedian Joy Behar’s breast has also resurfaced.
",-1
"Franken was a comedian before he ever entered the world of politics, and we understand that.
",-1
"But just because he was a comedian does not mean that he gets to play by a different set of rules.
",-1
"There appears to be an ongoing pattern of behavior, and Fox News has documented some of the other incidents that have come up in the past…
",-1
"Franken, at the time a writer for “SNL,” suggested one skit should play out with “60 Minutes” commentator Andy Rooney finding an empty pill bottle on his desk.

"Malagasy people have also been told not to carry out their traditional burial tradition of Famidihana which involves digging up their dead relatives every seven years.

"It means ‘turning the bones’ and sees families cleaning the remains, rewrapping them and reburying them while other family members perform a special dance.

"Since the airborne version of the plague can kill a person in just three hours, experts warn that its too soon to think that since there hasn’t been a person infected in recent days, that it won’t pop up again.
",-1
"“Outbreaks, generally, are managed reactively by ‘firefighting teams’, deployed to clear houses of fleas, identify and treat cases and give pre-emptive treatment to contacts at risk.
",-1
"A more preventative approach, such as the identification of areas at risk using climate models and animal surveys to focus flea and rat control efforts, would be better,” he said.
",-1
"“But, this requires a better understanding of transmission pathways in each region where disease persists.”
",-1
"The best way to stop the plague spreading was to focus on flea and rat control in the most at-risk areas, he said.
",-1
"Cheng’s comments came after at least 171 people died in Madagascar over an outbreak of plague.
",-1
"It’s been reported that plague has been transmitted to humans by camels, goats, prairie dogs, rock squirrels and guinea pigs since the 1960’s.
",-1
"There are only a few remaining hotspots for plague in the world – Madagascar being one of them.

"How Do You Like Paying For Sexual Harassment Settlements from Your Congress, America?
",-1
"We finally have the official numbers, and they aren’t pretty.
",-1
"Reid Wilson, a correspondent for the Hill, has posted to Twitter a year by year breakdown of sexual harassment settlements and awards that he received from the Congressional Office of Compliance.
",-1
"I went ahead and added up each column, and what I discovered is that 264 cases of sexual harassment in Congress have been settled since 1997, and the total amount awarded in those settlements comes to a grand total of $17,250,854.
",-1
"So where has the $17,250,854 come from to pay those settlements?
",-1
"That money has come from the taxpayers of course.
",-1
"When U.S. Representative Jackie Speier originally told us that more than 15 million dollars had been paid out to victims of sexual harassment in recent years, I was envisioning a few dozen cases at most.
",-1
"I had no idea that the total number of cases would actually be well over 200.
",-1
"If our leaders were serious about stopping this from happening, they would pass a law making it mandatory that all cases of sexual harassment in Congress be made public, and that members of Congress would be personally responsible for paying out any settlements.
",-1
"If such a law was instituted, I guarantee you that sexual harassment on Capitol Hill would come to a screeching halt.
",-1
"But they don’t want it to stop.
",-1
"I included the following quote from CNN in an article the other day, but I also believe that it fits just perfectly here…
",-1
"Do you want to stop this from happening?
",-1
"Morality really matters when it comes to serving in public office, and we are not going to send people that engage in sexually inappropriate behavior to Washington anymore.

"And I am calling on Congress to immediately release the details of all of the 264 cases of sexual harassment that have been settled since 1997.

",-1
"Sara, let’s start with your report.
",-1
"SARAH CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: It is Sean.
",-1
"I mean there’s over 5,000 documents which include emails, briefs, other documentation, memorandums that the informant had turned over to the FBI and Justice Department, and within these documents, it’s very evident of Russia’s intention to enter the American market, energy market.
",-1
"And their intentions to acquire uranium one.
",-1
"HANNITY: John, you go into extensive detail in a very long and hard-hitting piece tonight and revealing piece, how the FBI informant — you actually said six years, I thought he was only an informant for four years.
",-1
"He has evidence, was on the inside, directly from Putin’s Russia, the push for nuclear fuel deals, and all the crimes we talked about, bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering, all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further.
",-1
"Go into your report.
",-1
"JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: You know, Sara just said something about the importance of the dominance of the uranium market.
",-1
"This is an email that the FBI has had for six years.
",-1
"That would put the United States at a disadvantage.
",-1
"That is the sort of evidence that this FBI informant has right now.
",-1
"If you go back on the last week we heard several things from the Justice Department, there’s no connection to uranium one.
",-1
"These are emails that say uranium one that are in the FBI files.
",-1
"They said that there was no connection between the uranium one case and the criminal case.
",-1
"We now know the criminal case got its first evidence in 2009, a whole year before the uranium one deal was approved by the Obama administration.
",-1
"There are a lot of things that people have been saying that these documents simply don’t agree with.
",-1
"HANNITY: All right.
",-1
"I got a very high ranking Congressman and that knows, let us put it that way, and actually sent me a note.
",-1
"The knowledge of key administration officials will be the next thing proven by both of you, and the links to the Clinton foundation.
",-1
"Sara, is that true?
",-1
"CARTER: I believe that is true.
",-1
"I mean especially when we at —
",-1
"HANNITY: Do believe or you know?
",-1
"I can’t ask Victoria that question because she won’t tell me.
",-1
"CARTER: I know it’s true.
",-1
"I know that looking at these documents following the money, following the money is what’s important here.
",-1
"The Justice Department has not pointed out that they will possibly call a special counsel to this.
",-1
"This is still out there.
",-1
"They are looking into it.
",-1
"That is something that they need to decide.
",-1
"But whether it’s a special counsel or whether it’s a prosecutor that is investigating this, they will be able to follow the money.
",-1
"There are somethings said …
",-1
"HANNITY: When you say follow the money, my suspicion would go to the money came directly from Russia, was funneled through the Canadian donors to the Clinton Foundation.
",-1
"How good are my instincts?
",-1
"CARTER: You have pretty good instincts.
",-1
"I think there’s a lot of other areas that they will be looking at as well.
",-1
"Remember this is like peeling back an onion.
",-1
"You peel one part and then you find another part.

"And that is what’s going to require somebody to do an extensive investigation.
",-1
"HANNITY: But it is beginning to cascade Sara.
",-1
"CARTER: It is.
",-1
"HANNITY: John, I want her to respond to the same thing, that the Clinton Foundation, that this will be traced back to high-ranking Obama administration officials and the Clinton Foundation, and if you add the money portion Sara mentioned?
",-1
"SOLOMON: I do.
",-1
"I think the place we will be talking about in the next couple weeks as the Clinton global initiative.
",-1
"Sort of a side project of the Clinton Foundation.
",-1
"There are new flows of money there that we will report on then the next couple of weeks.
",-1
"It will be able to talk about that in the next couple of weeks.

"Another layer of interest of the story.
",-1
"We have a lot of time in the segment so I want to go very slowly here.
",-1
"Both of you, before I get to Victoria, Sara and John, you both in your pieces said 5,000 documents.
",-1
"I hear the number the FBI informant is much, much greater, tens of thousands.
",-1
"True or false?
",-1
"SOLOMON: That seems to be accurate.

"One of the great attorneys.
",-1
"She is the most difficult to get any information out of.
",-1
"Victoria, one of the things I’ve known about you, and I’ve interviewed you so many times over the years, you now have been doing a deep dive into all of this.
",-1
"You are now representing this FBI informant.
",-1
"VICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING FBI INFORMANT: Let me go to number one first, that is the whole essence of what John and Sara and I are talking about is that in 2009, 2010, our FBI and presumably our Justice Department, and the White House, as my client was told, all knew about this corruption in the Russian nuclear energy area.
",-1
"There’s no separate companies.
",-1
"They are all related.
",-1
"They are all one.
",-1
"They all talk to each other.

"So the evidence about this corruption was known to our government in 2009, 2010, and why is it that CFIUS either wasn’t told, or CFIUS people knowing about it —
",-1
"Uranium, why was that decision made?
",-1
"Was CFIUS told?
",-1
"Did Bob Mueller go to Eric Holder and tell him?
",-1
"Eric Holder sat on it.
",-1
"HANNITY: He was one of the nine.
",-1
"TOENSING: Did Bob Mueller go to the White House and tell him?
",-1
"The FBI agents told my client that they were briefing the President about his conduct.
",-1
"Of course, when the CFIUS decision was made.
",-1
"My client said, what happened?
",-1
"HANNITY: Back to my original question, counselor, if I may.
",-1
"You are too good at your job.
",-1
"This is a very serious point.
",-1
"Putting your legal hat on, objectively speaking, yes they knew, the evidence will prove it based on the documents and your client, crimes committed on a high level?
",-1
"National security compromise?
",-1
"I think that we are going to have to do is continue to follow the money because the reporting that John and Sara are going to be doing in a few days will be revealing about where lots of the various money went and where it came from.
",-1
"HANNITY: Always we go back, and I believe at the end of this you guys deserve a Pulitzer, and I’m not the only one thinking that.
",-1
"You have dug so deep on this, this has been a deep dive and I applaud you both.
",-1
"I want to ask as it relates to who knew what, and when.
",-1
"What did they know, when did they know it, John Solomon?
",-1
"I’m talking about Obama, Mueller, Eric Holder, and Hillary Clinton.
",-1
"SOLOMON: We are at a little disadvantage right now, because we don’t have those records, and also the records that Congress needs to go get, but I can tell you I have a person quoted in my story who has direct knowledge of what the Justice Department knew.
",-1
"HANNITY: President daily briefings were told.
",-1
"Had this information in it before CFIUS approves this.
",-1
"CARTER: Sean.
",-1
"That is what we need to find out.
",-1
"We need to see those Presidential daily briefings.
",-1
"Congress can get those.
",-1
"They will be able to know whether or not President Obama was briefed on this and according to a number of people that I have spoken with as well, he was.
",-1
"I think that will reveal a whole other layer of who knew what, where and when.
",-1
"And we follow the money and it will reveal even more about Hillary Clinton and what she knew and when did she know it, and the other members of the CFIUS board.
",-1
"HANNITY: And Obama and Holder and Mueller?
",-1
"John, real quick, we are running out of time.
",-1
"SOLOMON: yes listen, I think even Sessions and Rosenstein have questions to answer.

"According to Guatemalan authorities, Ohajacao-Ramos is accused of fatally shooting a store owner in his store in June 1997.
",-1
"Guatemalan law lists the charge as an assassination.
",-1
"Ohajacao-Ramos legally entered the United States in 1998 as a visitor and overstayed his temporary visa by more than 18 years.
",-1
"He was arrested at his home in Neosho, Missouri, in May 2017.
",-1
"In September, a federal immigration judge ordered him removed to his home country.
",-1
"Ohajacao-Ramos remained in ICE custody since his May arrest.

"“Removing foreign fugitives trying to escape law enforcement in their home countries is an ICE top priority,” said Ricardo Wong, field office director for ERO Chicago.

"Asteroid Will Skim By Earth Days Before Christmas: It Is ‘Potentially Hazardous’
",-1
"An asteroid called 3200 Phaethon will skim past the Earth just days before many will celebrate with Christmas festivities.
",-1
"The three-mile-wide asteroid is expected to miss the Earth, but it’s still labeled as “potentially hazardous,” and for good reasons.
",-1
"The asteroid will pass within 6.5 million miles of the Earth, which is relatively close in space terms, but still around 27 times the distance of the moon.
",-1
"Much closer flybys have occurred in the very recent past.
",-1
"Scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory are planning to use the opportunity to obtain a detailed 3D model of the asteroid, which has a particularly irregular shape.
",-1
"First detected in December 2007, 3200 Phaethon is widely thought to be the parent body for the Geminid meteor shower, which is due to peak this year on the night of December 13.
",-1
"This would make the Geminids one of only two major meteor showers not originating from a comet; the other being the Quadrantids in January.
",-1
"The main difference between asteroids and comets is their composition.
",-1
"Asteroids are made up of metals and rocky material, while comets are made up of ice, dust and rocky material.
",-1
"Comets which approach the Sun lose material with each orbit because some of their ice melts and vaporizes to form a tail.
",-1
"But the real question is will anyone be able to see the asteroid’s close approach to our planet.
",-1
"According to NASA, 3200 Phaethon will be visible in small telescopes for experienced observers in areas with dark skies.
",-1
"It is potentially detectable for three weeks but will be at its brightest between December 11 and 21.

"A San Francisco jury on Thursday found Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, also known as Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, not guilty of the murder of Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier on July 1, 2015.
",-1
"For Garcia’s Zarate’s attorney, Matt Gonzalez, Ralph Nader’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election, the trial was all about Donald Trump.
",-1
"“For those who might criticize this verdict – there are a number of people who have commented on this case in the last couple of years,” Gonzalez said after the verdict, “the Attorney General of the United States and the President and Vice President of the United States.
",-1
"I believe today is a day of vindication for the rights of immigrants.”
",-1
"Alex Bastian of the San Francisco prosecutor’s office told reporters the verdict “was not the one we were hoping for,” but the Steinle family could be forgiven for any reasonable doubts about the prosecution.
",-1
"Attorney David Wohl told Fox News that with negligent discharge of a firearm, the defendant’s action met every standard for involuntary manslaughter.
",-1
"Conservative Ben Shapiro told Fox news the verdict was “horrifying.
",-1
"No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.”
",-1
"Mexican national Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 54, is a seven-time felon and has been deported five times.
",-1
"In 2015 federal authorities sought to detain him for deportation.
",-1
"San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi chose to defy the feds and release the Mexican national.
",-1
"On July 1, 2015, the criminal illegal picked up a Sig Sauer .40 caliber pistol, stolen from a Bureau of Land Management officer, and fired the shot that killed Kate Steinle, only 32 years old.
",-1
"The felony firearms charge, the only charge on which Garcia Zarate was found guilty, carries a sentence of 16 months to 3 years.
",-1
"Since Garcia Zarate has been languishing in jail, the authorities could commute any sentence to time served and he could walk free within weeks.
",-1
"San Francisco is not likely to hand the felon over to ICE for deportation.
",-1
"Should that happen, Garcia Zarate has already proved five times that anybody can get away with violating U.S. immigration law.
",-1
"He has already proved that in the sanctuary state of California, false-documented illegals are a privileged class.
",-1
"Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, or whatever his real name is, has also proved that a career criminal who is not even supposed to be in the country can literally get away with murder in broad daylight.
",-1
"When that happens, the killer’s public defender will call it a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”

",-1
"As we detailed earlier, in a verdict that has shocked many in the Bay Area (and across America), a jury of six men and six women in sanctuary city San Francisco found illegal immigrant (and five-time deportee) Jose Ines Garcia Zarate not guilty in the death of Kate Steinle.
",-1
"Mr. Garcia Zarate had been homeless at the time of the shooting and had multiple felony convictions and five prior deportations to Mexico.
",-1
"He had been set free from jail only months before the shooting, in defiance of requests by federal immigration authorities, who had asked that he be held longer so he could be deported again.
",-1
"Ms. Steinle, known as Kate, a 32-year-old medical equipment saleswoman, was walking along Pier 14 in San Francisco when she was struck by a bullet and collapsed into her father’s arms.
",-1
"Mr. Garcia Zarate acknowledged firing the weapon, but said it was an accident.
",-1
"The bullet ricocheted on the pier’s concrete walkway before it struck Steinle, killing her.
",-1
"Zarate has admitted to shooting Steinle, but says it was an accident.
",-1
"Defense attorney Matt Gonzalez said Garcia Zarate found the gun at the pier… but the stories of what happened copntradicted one another…
",-1
"He said it was wrapped in cloth, and when Garcia Zarate unwrapped it, the gun accidentally discharged.
",-1
"But in a police interrogation, Garcia Zarate admitted to firing the gun, saying he was aiming at a seal.
",-1
"He also told police that he stepped on the gun, causing it to fire.
",-1
"But still, after six days of deliberation, the illegal Mexcian immigrant was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges and also found not guilty of assault with a firearm.
",-1
"Garcia Zarate was found guilty of illegal firearms possession, which carries a sentence of 16 months to three years.
",-1
"In a response to the verdict, Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a statement saying that despite California’s attempt at a murder conviction, Zarate was able to walk away with only a firearm possession conviction because he was not turned over by San Francisco to ICE.

"Social media erupted with outrage at the verdict (with very few – if any attempting to defend the verdict)…

"﻿Communion to Adulterers Promulgated as ""Authentic Magisterium""
",-1
"Last week, Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS)—the Vatican's organ for promulgating the Official Acts of the Apostolic See—published Pope Francis' October 2016 letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires in which he praised their episcopal guidelines allowing divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion in some cases while living in a state of objective mortal sin.
",-1
"If papal clarification was ever needed on the long-debated issue of the intended meaning of Amoris Laetitia chapter VIII, such clarification has now been provided for the Church at large.
",-1
"Concerning these guidelines that allow ""the possibility of access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist"" in ""complex circumstances"" where ""limitations that lessen the responsibility and guilt"" permit adulterous couples to continue in adultery, the pope said in his letter:
",-1
"""The document is very good and completely explains the meaning of chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia.
",-1
"There are no other interpretations.""
",-1
"Until now, the pope's letter to the Argentinian bishops had been considered a private letter with no binding force, whereas AAS has now elevated Pope Francis' letter to the official magisterial status of an ""Apostolic Letter,"" while including a special rescript as an addendum by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State.
",-1
"The rescript declares that Pope Francis expressly intends both documents—the papal letter and the episcopal guidelines—to bear the character of his ""authentic Magisterium,"" and that the pope has personally ordered their publication in AAS and on the Vatican website.
",-1
"Hence Amoris Laetitia VIII, which proposes that people living in adultery can be guiltless and thus be admitted to the sacraments of Confession and Communion when ""concrete circumstances"" make it difficult to renounce their adulterous state, is now declared ""magisterial"" by the Holy See.
",-1
"The problem with this is that heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial, so that if it is, it not only has no binding force, but the faithful are obliged to resist and refute such a declaration.
",-1
"St. Thomas Aquinas says in his Summa Theologiae: ""If the faith were endangered, a subject ought to rebuke his prelate [pope] even publicly.""
",-1
"The fact is that this latest promulgation is counter-magisterial, but the pope and his right-hand man now feel they have enough support from the dissenting left that enables them to come forward with it.
",-1
"Cardinal Parolin's rescript on the papal and episcopal documents reads as follows:
",-1
"Rescript ""from an Audience with His Holiness""
",-1
"The Supreme Pontiff decreed that the two preceding documents be promulgated through publication on the Vatican website and in Acta Apostolicae Sedis, as authentic Magisterium.
",-1
"From the Vatican Palace, on the day of June 5 in the year 2017
",-1
"Pietro Card.
",-1
"Parolin
",-1
"Secretary of State
",-1
"The Catholic Encyclopedia defines a papal rescript as follows: ""Rescripts are responses of the pope or a Sacred Congregation, in writing, to queries or petitions of individuals.
",-1
"Some rescripts concern the granting of favors; others the administration of justice, e.g.
",-1
"the interpretation of a law.""
",-1
"It appears then that Parolin's rescript constitutes a direct reply to the dubia of the Four Cardinals.
",-1
"Pope Francis' praise of the episcopal guidelines clearly answers the cardinals' query concerning his intention in Amoris Laetitia VIII, so will Cardinals Brandmuller and Burke now proceed to issue the formal correction of it?
",-1
"Each day, we see new evidence that this might have been a gross understatement.
",-1
"We shouldn't rule out the possibility that Francis may come forward one day and declare ""ex-cathedra"" that the interpretation of Amoris Laetitia VIII, as now taught by the Holy See, is promulgated as ""extraordinary magisterium.""
",-1
"In an interview with Catholic World Report (CWR) in December 2016, Cardinal Raymond Burke, who is presently a member of the Apostolic Signatura, said that if a pope were to ""formally profess heresy he would cease, by that act, to be the Pope.""
",-1
"Burke was reiterating Church teaching, as expressed by famed canonist Franz Wernz in his Ius Canonicum: ""In sum, it needs to be said clearly that a [publicly] heretical Roman Pontiff loses his power upon the very fact.""

"San Francisco Show Trial Sequel
",-1
"Last week, a San Francisco jury acquitted seven-time felon Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a repeatedly deported Mexican national, of all murder and manslaughter charges in the July 1, 2015, fatal shooting of Kate Steinle as she walked with her father and a friend on Pier 14.
",-1
"The jury found the confessed shooter guilty only of felony gun possession.
",-1
"Many observers decried the verdict as a travesty of justice, but they were mistaken if they thought it could not get any worse.
",-1
"San Francisco public defender Matt Gonzalez now seeks to have Zarate’s gun possession charge dismissed.
",-1
"Gonzalez is contending the jury should have been told that “momentary” possession of a gun is not necessarily a crime.
",-1
"“If you possess it just to dispose of it or abandon it, it wouldn’t be a crime,” Gonzalez told reporters.
",-1
"The Steinle family and relatives of murder victims have new cause for outrage, but this gambit is consistent with Gonzalez and the San Francisco show-trial in which he co-starred.
",-1
"Gonzalez hails from McAllen, Texas, and attended Columbia University on a scholarship.
",-1
"As he explained, “I think I was a product of affirmative action,” and ethnic preferences doubtless played a role in admission to Stanford Law School.
",-1
"The La Raza Lawyers Association named Gonzalez Lawyer of the Year, and the Mexican American Political Association, a group with roots in the Communist Party, gave him the Bert Corona award, after one of the CPUSA’s most high-profile Stalinists.
",-1
"In 2,000, after a decade as a public defender, Gonzalez gained election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.
",-1
"You have to rally and find ways of opposing what you don’t like.”
",-1
"In 2003 Gonzalez ran for mayor of San Francisco but lost to Gavin Newsom.
",-1
"In 2008 Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader tapped Gonzalez for vice president.
",-1
"On that score, the Steinle family and other relatives of murder victims have room for reasonable doubt.
",-1
"In jury selection, Gonzalez and the prosecutor, assistant district attorney Diana Garcia, included three “immigrants,” quite possibly false-documented illegals.
",-1
"True to form, judge Samuel Feng sealed the identities of the jurors.
",-1
"So observers have grounds to believe that Garcia and Gonzalez both got the jury they wanted.
",-1
"As it happens, in Russian roulette a shooter loads one bullet into a six-shot revolver, spins the cylinder, then puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger.
",-1
"In a central fact of the case, Zarate did not aim the gun at himself but fired in the direction of Kate Steinle.
",-1
"In another established fact, the bullet struck her in the lower back and tore through her abdominal aorta.
",-1
"This happened in broad daylight, but as in In the Heat of the Night, they had the body which was dead.
",-1
"Garcia Zarate confessed to firing the shot and had gunpowder residue on his hands.
",-1
"After firing, he tossed the gun in the water.
",-1
"He said he had found the stolen weapon wrapped in a cloth and that it discharged by itself, both utterly unbelievable claims.
",-1
"Even so, the politically correct jury found the career criminal not guilty of murder and manslaughter.
",-1
"Any observer could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted.
",-1
"Unlike Stalin’s trials of the old Bolsheviks, and Fidel Castro’ trial of General Arnaldo Ochoa, this show trial aimed to establish innocence for the guilty, and the dynamics of the left were on full display.
",-1
"Denunciations of “gun violence” were nowhere in evidence and expressions of sympathy for the Steinle family proved pathetically weak.
",-1
"As Arthur Koestler said, on the left the truth is spoken with loathing and falsehood with love.
",-1
"On the left, as Orwell had it in Animal Farm, rats are comrades, and criminals are victims of capitalist society.
",-1
"In this inexorable progress, determined by history, some people are going to have to die.
",-1
"Out for a summer-day walk with her father and a friend, Kate Steinle was a completely innocent victim, gunned down by a career criminal who was not even supposed to be in the country but found special protection in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, part of the sanctuary state of California.
",-1
"As defense attorney Francisco Ugarte said, the verdict was a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”

"Since Donald Trump mentioned the case, former vice-presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez had to establish the complete innocence of the shooter.

"The true children of Holy Church, at such times, are those who walk by the light of their Baptism, not the cowardly souls who, under the specious pretext of submission to the powers that be, delay their opposition to the enemy in the hope of receiving instructions which are neither necessary nor desirable.""

"Francis, writes Royal, “has little use for established procedures, precedents, even legal structures within the Church….
",-1
"When the head of the Church himself does not much feel bound by the tradition or impartial laws he has inherited, what then?” What then indeed?
",-1
"The Church has seen a number of Popes who have abused their power, Alexander VI being the most popularly known example.
",-1
"By publication in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Francis has officially declared that the “authentic Magisterium” includes the guidelines of the bishops of Buenos Aires for the implementation of Chapter 8 of Amoris Laetitia (AL), which he expressly approved in his letter to them as the only correct interpretation of his will.
",-1
"The guidelines have been published in the AAS along with Francis’s private missive, which is suddenly declared to be “an apostolic letter.”
",-1
"The normalist narrative has just been stripped of any colorable argument that nothing is too terribly amiss with this pontificate.
",-1
"We are now expected to believe that the “authentic Magisterium”—meaning simply and only AL—teaches what the guidelines preposterously declare, solely in reliance on AL:
",-1
"When the concrete circumstances of a couple make it feasible, especially when both are Christians with a journey of faith, one may propose that they commit to living in continence….
",-1
"In other more complex circumstances, and when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity, the aforementioned option may not, in fact, be viable.
",-1
"Nonetheless, it is equally possible to undertake a journey of discernment….
",-1
"[I]f one arrives at the recognition that, in a concrete case, there are limitations that diminish responsibility and culpability (cf.
",-1
"301-302), particularly when a person judges that he would fall into a subsequent fault by damaging the children of the new union, Amoris Laetitia opens up the possibility of access to the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (cf.
",-1
"notes 336 and 351).
",-1
"As Francis would have it, then, the “authentic Magisterium” has just flatly contradicted itself for the first time in two millennia:
",-1
"The admission of public adulterers in “second marriages” to Holy Communion, which John Paul II, in line with all of Tradition, called “ intrinsically impossible ” given their objective state in life, is now deemed possible depending on circumstances—that is, situation ethics applied to violations of the Sixth Commandment.
",-1
"The requirement that people embroiled in such unions commit to living in continence before they can be absolved and partake of the Blessed Sacrament—a moral norm binding “ without exception ” because it is rooted in divine law—is suddenly demoted to a mere “proposal” that may not be “feasible” or “viable” in “the concrete circumstances of the couple.”
",-1
"A valid annulment of a truly invalid marriage, the sine qua non for entering into marital relations with another purported spouse, is now dispensed with in “more complex circumstances… when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity,” the way thus being opened to de facto divorce in the Catholic Church.
",-1
"The meaningless slogan “journey of discernment” cloaks a naked authorization for the official toleration of adulterous sexual relations in the Church’s sacramental life.
",-1
"No less than a Roman Pontiff lends his name to the outrageous claim that children resulting from an adulterous relationship, blithely referred to as a “new union,” could be “damaged” if the partners in adultery were required to cease their adultery in order to be absolved and receive Holy Communion—evidently because the “new union” would dissolve without adulterous sexual relations and there could be a second divorce!
",-1
"This appeared in the last Print-Edition of The Remnant.
",-1
"See what else you missed.
",-1
"Francis, however, has purported to do nothing less invent exceptions to divine law that oppose the doctrine of the Church.
",-1
"The attempt is void, of course, and the appellation “authentic Magisterium” is fraudulent.
",-1
"Over the past year, Cardinal Burke and a few other members of the hierarchy have called upon Francis to “clarify” his intention respecting AL.
",-1
"That clarification has now been given: Francis intends, if it were possible, to change the unchangeable teaching of the Church regarding an irrevocable moral norm rooted in divine law.
",-1
"No Pope before him has ever dared to do such a thing.
",-1
"So now it must be asked: Where are the cardinals and the bishops?
",-1
"With one or two noble (however inconsistent) exceptions, their response to the Bergoglian Debacle thus far ranges from silence, to active complicity, to—at best—hand-wringing over the increasingly chaotic state of the Church while begging the Pope to “clarify” his already perfectly clear intentions.
",-1
"Their failure to defend the Faith by standing up to the one they know full well is attacking it almost daily lends itself ever more to an indictment for timidity in the face of unprecedented danger to the Church and the cause of the Gospel of which they are divinely charged to be leaders.
",-1
"Prudence now gives way to mere pusillanimity.
",-1
"The time for hierarchical action is now, before the damage to the Church becomes irreparable.
",-1
"Where in our Church are the leaders who can show us the right path?
",-1
"What we need today is a new Athanasius, a new Basil, bishops like those who in the fourth century fought courageously against Arianism when almost the whole of Christendom had succumbed to heresy.
",-1
"Will none of the hierarchs rise to defend the Church as “a new Athanasius, a new Basil”?
",-1
"Even the best among them continue to limit themselves to generalized lamentations at conferences or in interviews about the parlous state of the Church or at most the “confusion” Francis has caused by not “clarifying” precisely what he has just clarified.
",-1
"They avoid the absolutely necessary direct and public exposure of error at its source.
",-1
"Concerned clergy and laity throughout the Catholic world are doing what they can according to their stations.
",-1
"This undeniably apocalyptic development imposes upon the hierarchs—first and foremost in the Church—the duty to act.
",-1
"True love for the Church, indeed true charity toward Francis himself, requires of them nothing less than what was required of Saint Paul when the first Pope fell into error that jeopardized the very mission of the Church: that Peter be withstood to his face (Gal.
",-1
"2:11).
",-1
"May Our Lady of Fatima intercede to obtain for them the grace of fortitude to do what must be done and what only they can do.

"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)
",-1
"Given that Pope Francis has, since that interview took place, attempted to make the Argentine bishops’ interpretation of AL 'magisterial'--an interpretation that allows public adulterers to receive Holy Communion--Cardinal Burke’s reply to my question on January 9th of this year would seem to take on new relevancy.
",-1
"In my interview of Raymond Cardinal Burke less than one year ago, I asked His Eminence to clarify what, exactly, is the level of authoritative weight of Pope Francis’s post-synodal exhortation, Amoris Laetitia.
",-1
"Now, Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, president of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, made it very clear to the Catholic News Service on December 5 what the Pope is up to: “The fact that the pope requested that his letter and the interpretations of the Buenos Aires bishops be published in the AAS means that His Holiness has given these documents a particular qualification that elevates them to the level of being official teachings of the church.
",-1
"While the content of the pope’s letter itself does not contain teachings on faith and morals, it does point toward the interpretations of the Argentine bishops and confirms them as authentically reflecting his own mind.
",-1
"Thus together the two documents became the Holy Father’s authentic magisterium for the whole church.”
",-1
"Francis made it clear that the Argentine bishops’ interpretation of AL allowing public adulterers to receive Holy Communion “explains precisely the meaning of Chapter VIII of ‘Amoris Laetitia.’ There are no other interpretations.”
",-1
"The moment, it would seem, has come.
",-1
"Cardinal Burke, please and in God's Holy Name, we beg you to act now -- before Pope Francis succeeds in tearing the Church in half completely.
",-1
"We thank God for the courage you've shown in defending His Church thus far, and we pray he will continue to bless and protect you as you do what must now be done.

"The Sun Is Going DARK: No Sunspots For 96 Days; Ice Age Approaches
",-1
"NASA’s own data is showing that the star our globe revolves around is dimming.
",-1
"With no sunspots reported in 96 days, the sun is going dark and the evidence could point to an approaching ice age.
",-1
"As the sun gets successively more blank with each day, due to lack of sunspots, it is also dimming, says the website Watts Up With That?
",-1
"According to data from NASA’s Spaceweather, so far in 2017, 96 days (27%) of the days observing the sun have been without sunspots.

"Today at Cape Canaveral, SpaceXlaunched a new sensor to the International Space Station named TSIS-1.
",-1
"Its mission: to measure the dimming of the sun’s irradiance.
",-1
"It will replace the aging SORCE spacecraft.
",-1
"NASA SDO reports that as the sunspot cycle plunges toward its 11-year minimum, NASA satellites are tracking a decline in total solar irradiance (TSI).

"–Watts Up With That?

"The Daily Sheeple’s Joe Joseph breaks it down for those who don’t closely follow the sun’s changes.
",-1
"He says there is a correlation between major changes on the sun and the behavior of the Earth, especially now as it reaches its 11-year-cycle’s solar minimum.
",-1
"“I guess you could say, in a very generalistic sense…and I mean, this is as vanilla as you can possibly make it…that as the sun gets quieter so does our magnetic field get weaker or so it appears to be,” says Joseph.

"“Is there a mini ice age coming?
",-1
"I don’t know,” he said.
",-1
"But other sources say it’s more than possible that we will see a mini ice age in the next three years due to the dimming of our sun.
",-1
"A 15-YEAR long mini ice age could be due to hit the Northern hemisphere in just four years as the sun prepares for “hibernation” – triggering a barrage of cataclysmic events, says The Express UK in 2016.
",-1
"Solar activity, measured by the appearance of sun spots, has been declining at a greater rate than at any other time in history.
",-1
"And that could have widespread implications.

"Research by the The Space and Science Research Center in Florida revealed a strong link between low solar activity and seismic events.

"New Footage From Las Vegas Massacre Reveals Possible Muzzle Flashes From Helicopters That May Have Conducted “Air Assault”
",-1
"Does this new footage reveal muzzle flashes from helicopters, an air assault, on the night of the massacre?
",-1
"What appears to be muzzle flashes emitting from multiple aircraft can be seen on numerous videos captured on the night of the massacre.
",-1
"LAS VEGAS (INTELLIHUB) — Newly released footage of the October 1 massacre posted on YouTube by the NICK VEGAS channel appears to confirm what Intellihub’s founder and editor-in-chief Shepard Ambellas pointed out in late October when he presented evidence of the strategic air assault on The Alex Jones Show in great detail.
",-1
"The video shows what appears to be muzzle flashes emanating from the airspace between the Delano Hotel and Mandalay Bay, an airspace that should be free of obstruction altogether.
",-1
"A major analysis of this matter was done by Ambellas in mid-November which revealed that no aircraft should be occupying that airspace between the hours of 10:05 and 10:15 p.m. on the night of the shooting (i.e.
",-1
"no aircraft are visible on the radar in that airspace during that time.)
",-1
"Not to mention the fact that helicopters are not allowed to hover in the City of Las Vegas without a permit nor are they allowed to lurk behind buildings lower than their roof lines.
",-1
"The first of a series of muzzles flashes can be seen coming from several different elevations, possibly from as many as 3 aircraft (helicopters).
",-1
"The flashes which are not consistent with FAA required running lights in any way can be seen starting at 0:19 seconds into the video.
",-1
"Note: To see the flashes you must view the video on ‘1080p’ and set it to ‘full screen’ and look between the two hotels (adjust the video speed to 25%.)
",-1
"The exact same aircraft and apparent muzzles flashes can also be seen in the Arch Angel Studios “First Shots” video which was posted to YouTube on Oct. 2, just one day after the shooting.

"It’s no secret that the Trump administration has a strong distaste for Iran.
",-1
"Iran is one of the only issues on which the U.S. president has remained relatively consistent.
",-1
"Trump berated the country both before and after taking office.
",-1
"Fortunately for Trump, however, he is not alone in his bid to isolate and demonize Iran at all costs.
",-1
"On December 12, Trump’s ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, gave a grandiose speech demonizing Iran that echoed Colin Powell’s infamous performance before the U.N. in 2003.
",-1
"Haley’s essential claim was that Saudi Arabia is under attack by missiles supplied to Yemen by the Iranian government and that the world should not sit idly by as this goes on.
",-1
"“There is clear evidence that the missiles that landed on Saudi Arabia come from Iran,” she said.
",-1
"“The evidence is undeniable.
",-1
"Buy Gold at Discounted Prices
",-1
"However, even as Haley opened her mouth, many commentators could already identify a number of issues with her speech.
",-1
"As Common Dream’s Reza Marashi explained:
",-1
"“Haley cited a UN report in her claim regarding Iranian missile transfers to the Houthis.
",-1
"Of course, the UN has reached no such conclusion.
",-1
"Instead, a panel of experts concluded that fired missile fragments show components from an Iranian company, but they have ‘no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier.’ Asked about Haley’s claim that Iran is the culprit, Sweden’s ambassador to the UN said, ‘The info I have is less clear.’ Analysts from the U.S. Department of Defense speaking to reporters at Haley’s speech openly acknowledged that they do not know the missiles’ origin.
",-1
"Perhaps most surreal is the very same UN report cited by Haley also says the missile included a component that was manufactured by an American company.
",-1
"Did she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remarks, or fail to read the entire UN report?
",-1
"The world may never know.”
",-1
"Ritter writes:
",-1
"“The missile debris in question actually contradicts the finding of the UN panel, which held that the missiles launched against Saudi Arabia had been transferred to Yemen in pieces and assembled there by Houthi missile engineers; it is clear that the missiles in question had been in the possession of Yemen well before the Saudi Arabian-led intervention of 2015, and that their source was either Soviet or North Korean.
",-1
"The modification kits, on the other hand, appear to be of Iranian origin, and were transported to Yemen via Oman.
",-1
"The UN panel claims not to have any evidence of ‘external missile specialists’ working alongside the Houthi; indeed, the simplicity of the Burkhan 2-H modification concept is such that anyone already familiar with the SCUD-B missile system would be able to implement the required processes without outside assistance.” [emphasis added]
",-1
"So where did the missiles come from, and who made them?
",-1
"According to Ritter:
",-1
"“Rather than the Iranian-manufactured Qiam-1 missiles Haley and the Saudi Arabian government claimed, the debris presented by Haley were of a modified Soviet-manufactured SCUD-B missile; the airframe and engine are original Soviet-made components, and many of the smaller parts on display bear Cyrillic (i.e., Russian) markings.
",-1
"The transformation to the Burkhan 2-H design required the Houthi engineers to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and lengthen the airframe accordingly.
",-1
"This is done by cutting the airframe, and welding in place the appropriate segments (this also required that the fuel supply pipe, which passes through the oxidizer tank, be similarly lengthened.)
",-1
"The difference in quality between the factory welds and the new welds is readily discernable.
",-1
"The increased fuel supply permits a longer engine burn, which in turn increases the range of the missile.
",-1
"The Burkhan 2-H uses a smaller warhead than the SCUD B; as such, the guidance and control section had been reconfigured to a smaller diameter, and an inter-stage section added to connect the warhead/guidance section with the main airframe.”
",-1
"Those who have been paying attention to this conflict have been well aware that the U.S. has had little material evidence to link Yemen’s Houthis to Iranian arms suppliers.
",-1
"In January of this year, a panel of U.N. experts stated:
",-1
"“The panel has not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct large-scale supply of arms from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, although there are indicators that anti-tank guided weapons being supplied to the Houthi or Saleh forces are of Iranian manufacture.” [emphasis added]
",-1
"Why is the U.S. singling out Iran, especially when the Houthi rebels are sworn enemies of al-Qaeda?
",-1
"The issues here go much deeper than nonsensical hypocrisy.
",-1
"According to Ritter, the entire debacle has shown that if Saudi Arabia cannot contain the Houthi’s missile capabilities, it cannot possibly hope to take on Iran, which possesses a significantly more advanced military than the Houthis do on their own.
",-1
"Ritter explains further:
",-1
"“If a relatively unsophisticated foe such as the Houthi, using Iranian-modified Soviet and North Korean missiles derived from 40-year-old technology, can evade an enemy force using the most modern combat aircraft backed up by the most sophisticated intelligence gathering systems available, and successfully launch ballistic missiles that threaten the political and economic infrastructure of the targeted state, what does that say about the prospects of any U.S.-led coalition taking on the far more advanced mobile missile threats that exist in North Korea and Iran today?
",-1
"The fact of the matter is that no military anywhere has shown the ability to successfully interdict in any meaningful way a determined opponent armed with mobile ballistic missile capability.
",-1
"If the Saudi experience in Yemen is to teach us anything, it is that any military plan designed to confront nations such as North Korea, Iran and Russia that are armed with sophisticated mobile ballistic missiles had better count on those capabilities remaining intact throughout any anticipated period of hostility.
",-1
"Determined to quell any Catholic opposition to his moral subversion, Francis has slapped the label Authentic Magisterium® on his outrageous opinion that in “complex circumstances” wherein it is not “feasible” to live as brother and sister, two people who are not married can be admitted to Holy Communion without ceasing extra-marital sexual relations so long as they engage in an ill-defined “process of discernment.” As Father Brian Harrison has so trenchantly observed, this means that people embroiled in adultery can receive Holy Communion while they “discern” that they should not be receiving Holy Communion because they are embroiled in adultery.
",-1
"Do they think we are fools?
",-1
"Then there is the endlessly double-talking Cardinal Müller.
",-1
"It is possible that the penitent may be convinced in conscience, and with good reasons, of the invalidity of the first marriage even though they cannot offer canonical proof.
",-1
"In this case the marriage valid before God would be the second one and the pastor could grant the sacrament, certainly with the appropriate precautions as not to scandalize the community of the faithful and not to weaken the conviction of marriage indissolubility.
",-1
"Moreover, absent an annulment granted by the competent Church tribunal, a purported “second marriage” can only be an invalid civil ceremony and thus a thinly disguised form of continuous public adultery.
",-1
"Such cases do not exist.
",-1
"No priest has the authority to declare a marriage null in the internal forum.
",-1
"Marriage is a public state in the Church, and the judgment regarding an accusation of nullity of marriage must be made in accord with the long practice of the Church.
",-1
"If a college of judges in a matrimonial tribunal is not able to arrive at moral certitude regarding the nullity of a marriage after a careful and thorough examination of the petition of nullity, how can an individual priest be capable of making such a judgment having to do with the eternal salvation of the soul in question?
",-1
"The only case in which a priest could admit a person living in an irregular matrimonial union to receive the Sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist is the case of a couple who agree to live “as brother and sister”, that is to respect the marriage to which they are bound by not living in a marital way with another person.
",-1
"Even then, the priest would have to insist that the couple living in continence receive the Sacraments in a place in which they are not well known, lest other faithful be led to believe that persons living in an irregular matrimonial union may receive the Sacraments.
",-1
"Does Cardinal Müller think we are fools?
",-1
"Some of us apparently are, or at least are willing to serve as knowing dupes by defending neo-Pharisaical sophistry that would produce “a discipline alien to the entire Tradition of the Catholic and Apostolic faith.”
",-1
"Consider the recent declaration by one of Francis’s new appointments to the Pontifical Academy for Life, whose entire membership he sacked and whose constitution he ordered rewritten to neutralize it.
",-1
"In a lecture at the Gregorian, one Father Maurizio Chiodi, a “moral theologian” of the post-Vatican II variety, proposed that “an artificial method for the regulation of births could be recognized as anact of responsibilitythat is carried out, not in order to radically reject the gift of a child, but because in those situationsresponsibility calls the couple and the family to other forms of welcome and hospitality.”
",-1
"That is, Francis’s man at the reconstituted Pontifical Academy declares openly that there is a duty to contracept!
",-1
"AL will doubtless be providing cover for a whole new line of Authentic Magisterium® products, all of which will be utter fakes, including some form of “pastoral integration” of homosexual unions.
",-1
"(Consider the example of Catholic Answers, which “defends the Faith” while refusing to recognize that it is under ferocious attack from the very vertices of the Church.
",-1
"But we are not fools.
",-1
"And God will not be mocked.
",-1
"Francis and all his designs will ultimately come to nothing.
",-1
"Meanwhile, ours is but to keep the Faith and protest before God and man the blows now raining down against the Church, even when they come from a wayward Roman Pontiff at her summit.
",-1

"ICE Arrests 22 In Chicago Area During 3-Day Operation
",-1
"CHICAGO — Federal officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrested 22 criminal aliens and immigration violators in Illinois’ Cook and Lake counties during a three-day enforcement action, which ended Monday.
",-1
"During this operation, ERO deportation officers made arrests in the following Illinois cities and towns: Chicago (9), Cicero (4), Hoffman Estates (1), Palatine (4), Park City (1), Rolling Meadows (2) and Round Lake Beach (1).
",-1
"All those arrested were men between the ages of 20 and 53.
",-1
"Aliens arrested during this operation are from the following five countries: Ecuador (1), Honduras (2), Mexico (17), Serbia (1) and Ukraine (1).
",-1
"Six of the 22 arrested during this operation were criminal aliens who were released back into their communities after local law enforcement failed to honor an immigration detainer placed on the individuals by ICE.
",-1
"Immigration detainers request that ICE be notified before the individual is released from local custody for any reason.
",-1
"Most of the aliens targeted by ERO deportation officers during this operation had prior criminal histories that included convictions for the following crimes: sexual assault, kidnapping, assault, assault with a weapon, drug possession, theft, obstruction of justice and driving under the influence (DUI); two were known fugitive immigration violators, and six were arrested for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported, which is a felony.
",-1
"The following are criminal summaries of the offenders arrested in Illinois during this operation:
",-1
"A 38-year-old Mexican citizen and a known gang member was arrested Jan. 8 in Rolling Meadows.
",-1
"He was previously convicted in Cook County for felony aggravated criminal sexual assault and bodily harm.
",-1
"He was previously deported.
",-1
"Cook County Sheriff’s Office did not honor the ICE detainer that was placed.
",-1
"He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation.
",-1
"A 37-year-old previously deported Mexican man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago.
",-1
"He was previously convicted twice of drug possession, and he has pending criminal charges for sexually assaulting a child.
",-1
"A 20-year-old Mexican man and a known gang member was arrested Jan. 7 in Round Lake Beach.
",-1
"He was previously convicted of battery.
",-1
"He is also Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient with two extensions.
",-1
"He was served a notice to appear before a federal immigration judge, and will remain in ICE custody pending disposition of his immigration proceedings.
",-1
"A 32-year-old previously deported Ecuadoran man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago.
",-1
"He has criminal convictions for DUI, domestic assault and assault.
",-1
"A 46-year-old previously deported Mexican man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago.
",-1
"He has a criminal conviction for possessing cocaine.
",-1
"Depending on an alien’s criminality, an alien who re-enters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted.
",-1
"“This operation focused on targeting immigration fugitives and criminal aliens in two Illinois counties, but we routinely conduct operations daily.

",-1
"They are merely economic migrants seeking a better life,” Orban concluded.
",-1
"In his view, the government simply can’t go against the will of the people.
",-1
"RT continues:
",-1
"Going further, the prime minister noted that no refugee wants to go to Portugal, for example, adding that the majority of asylum seekers simply wanted to live in prosperous Germany.
",-1
"Orban specifically targeted Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ‘open-door’ policy towards asylum seekers.
",-1
"“If someone wants to come to your house, he knocks on your door and asks: ‘Can we come in, can we stay?’ They [asylum seekers] didn’t do that, they crossed the border illegally,” he stated.
",-1
"Orban then did what most political representatives will simply not do, he told the truth about multiculturalism.
",-1
"Of course, they won't.
",-1
"They can't even agree on the means of proselytizing and of what real spiritual weapons are.
",-1
"PM Orban has remained consistent.
",-1
"Orban's border wall reduced illegal immigration by 99%!
",-1
"He has genuinely reached out his hand to help Christian migrants instead of Muslim migrants and he seems to be one that holds to the Christian faith, as emulated by the Protestant Reformers, saying, ""That which serves the glory of God is the best for the people.""

"The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.
",-1
"–DOJ
",-1
"While the indictment lists Lambert’s company as “Transportation Corporation A,” a simple search reveals that Lambert is the co-President of DAHER-TLI, “the leading front end freight forwarding company dedicated to Nuclear Cargo,” according to its website.
",-1
"In 2012, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent a letter to Lambert with findings that TLI had exported plutonium “in excess of the maximum quantity and type applied for and licensed,” and “exported Australian obligated material, which was not authorized under license conditions.”
",-1
"The indictment against Lambert corroborates prior reporting by The Hill that an FBI mole buried deep within the Russian nuclear industry had gathered extensive evidence of a scheme involving bribes and kickbacks between Russian nuclear officials and TLI – which would have transported the U.S. uranium sold to Russia in the ’20 percent’ Uranium One deal.
",-1
"And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.”
",-1
"Based on what the FBI knew – including evidence which purportedly includes a video of Russians preparing briefcases of bribe money – the Uranium One deal never should have gone through.
",-1
"Moreover, both Robert Mueller and current deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were directly involved – and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other Justice Department officials appear to be covering for them.
",-1
"In short, the FBI had ample evidence of the Russian bribery plot before the Obama administration approved the Uranium One deal thanks to their embedded mole in the Russian nuclear industry.

"official and former Chief Counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee Victoria Toensing.
",-1
"After Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-VA) demanded Campbell be allowed to testify in front of Congress, the gag order was lifted.
",-1
"Attorney General Jeff Sessions originally tried to claim that there was no connection between Uranium One and the nuclear transport bribery case, however several congressional republicans pushed back:
",-1
"“Attorney General Sessions seemed to say that the bribery, racketeering and money laundering offenses involving Tenex’s Vadim Mikerin occurred after the approval of the Uranium One deal by the Obama administration.
",-1
"But we know that the FBI’s confidential informant was actively compiling incriminating evidence as far back as 2009,” Rep. Ron DeSantis, (R-Fla.) told The Hill.
",-1
"“It is hard to fathom how such a transaction could have been approved without the existence of the underlying corruption being disclosed.
",-1
"I hope AG Sessions gets briefed about the CI and gives the Uranium One case the scrutiny it deserves,” added DeSantis, whose House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittees is one of the investigating panels.
",-1
"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a similar rebuke last week to Rosenstein, saying the deputy attorney general’s first response to the committee “largely missed the point” of the congressional investigations.
",-1
"“The essential question is whether the Obama Justice Department provided notice of the criminal activity of certain officials before the CFIUS approval of the Uranium One deal and other government decisions that enabled the Russians to trade nuclear materials in the U.S,” Grassley scolded.”
",-1
"Meanwhile, journalists John Solomon and journalist Sara Carter claim to have copies of the FBI informant’s evidence, while Carter issued an explosive report in late November laying out the players, the timeline, and the evidence at hand.
",-1
"“By the time the sale of Uranium One was approved by the Obama Administration, the FBI’s investigators had already gathered substantial evidence and the bureau was also aware of Russia’s intentions to enter the U.S. energy market and its desire to purchase a stake in American uranium,” Carter writes.
",-1
"Highlights:
",-1
"FBI mole William Campbell was a highly valued FBI asset – paid $51,000 by FBI officials at a celebration dinner in Chrystal City, VA, where Campbell’s attorney says they thanked him for his service.
",-1
"Campbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money – which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian “nuclear money laundering apparatus”
",-1
"Campbell collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period
",-1
"Campbell uncovered a Russian plot to penetrate the Obama administration and gain approval for the Uranium One sale, including a 2010 email which describes “Russia’s intent on expanding its Uranium expansion in the United States.”
",-1
"“This is not just about bribery and kickbacks but about a U.S. company that was transporting yellow-cake for the Russians with our approval,” an unnamed U.S. Intelligence official told Carter, adding “This should raise serious questions.
",-1
"At the time everyone was concerned about Russia’s ties to Iran, we still are.
",-1
"And of course, Russia’s intentions and reach into the U.S. energy market.”
",-1
"Given Friday’s unsealed indictment, however it looks like the DOJ may have changed their tune on Campbell.
",-1
"If so, perhaps that “briefcase full of bribe money” video will finally see the light of day.

"“Islamic Converts Ask Pope in Open Letter To Change His Teaching on Islam,” by Steve Skojec, OnePeterFive.com, January 11, 2018:
",-1
"A new, open letter to the pope is making the rounds on the Internet, and it has gathered over 2,600 signatures so far.
",-1
"“Most Holy Father,” it begins, “‬Many of us ‬have tried to contact you, ‬on many occasions ‬and for several years, ‬and we have never received the slightest acknowledgement of our letters or requests for meetings.”
",-1
"The letter is not from the dubia cardinals, or from the more than 800,000 signers of the 2015 Filial Appeal, or from the signatories of the Filial Correction, but from a group of Islamic converts to Catholicism, who want Francis to answer a simple question: why did they literally risk their lives to become Catholic if Islam is “a good religion in itself” as the pope “seems to teach”?
",-1
"It’s a question he refuses to answer, despite endless platitudes of how important it is to be close to the marginalized and to accompany those on the peripheries of the Church.
",-1
"The signers, however, are not dissuaded in their pursuit of a paternal answer:
",-1
"Do not your words question the soundness of the choice we made at the risk of our lives?
",-1
"Islam prescribes death for apostates (Quran 4.89, 8.7-11), do you know?
",-1
"How is it possible to compare Islamic violence with so-called Christian violence?
",-1
"“What is the relationship between Christ and Satan?
",-1
"What union is there between light and darkness?
",-1
"What association between the faithful and the unfaithful?” (2 Cor 6: 14-17)In accordance with His teaching (Lk 14:26), we preferred Him, the Christ, to our own life.
",-1
"Are we not in a good position to talk to you about Islam?
",-1
"The letter makes short work of the notion that Islam and Christianity can ever be compatible, or that Islam can serve as a path to salvation:
",-1
"In fact, as long as Islam wants us to be its enemy, we are, and all our protestations of friendship cannot change anything.
",-1
"We must not be deceived by the Quranic verses deemed tolerant, because they have all been repealed by the verse of the Sword (Quran 9.5).
",-1
"Also, as it was in the face of Nazism and communism, naiveté in the face of Islam is suicidal and very dangerous.
",-1
"How can you speak of peace and endorse Islam, as you seem to do: “To wring from our hearts the disease that plagues our lives (…) Let those who are Christians do it with the Bible and those who are Muslims do it with the Quran.
",-1
"“(Rome, January 20, 2014)?
",-1
"That the Pope seems to propose the Quran as a way of salvation, is that not cause for worry?
",-1
"Should we return to Islam?
",-1
"the welcoming of migrants regardless of the fact that they are Muslims, something forbidden by Apostolic command: “If anyone comes to you but refuses this Gospel, do not receive him among you nor greet him.
",-1
"Whoever greets him participates in his evil works.” (2 John 1.10-11); “If anyone preaches to you a different Gospel, let him be accursed!” (Galatians 1.8-9)
",-1
"The pro-Islam speech of Your Holiness leads us to deplore the fact that Muslims are not invited to leave Islam, and that many ex-Muslims, such as Magdi Allam, are even leaving the Church, disgusted by her cowardice, wounded by equivocal gestures, confused by the lack of evangelization, scandalized by the praise given to Islam … Thus ignorant souls are misled…
",-1
"Taking the matter further, they warn, too, of the physical danger the pope’s disposition toward Islam invites, saying that it has resulted in Christians
",-1
"not preparing for a confrontation with Islam, to which St. John Paul II has called them (Ecclesia in Europa, No.
",-1
"57).
",-1
"I have lost my diocese.
",-1
"(…) You are welcoming into your country an ever increasing number of Muslims.
",-1
"You are in danger as well.
",-1
"You must make strong and courageous decisions (…).
",-1
"You think that all men are equal, but Islam does not say that all men are equal.
",-1
"(…) If you do not understand this very quickly, you will become the victims of the enemy that you have invited into your home.” (August 9, 2014) “.
",-1
"This is a matter of life and death, and any complacency towards Islam is treasonous.
",-1
"We do not wish the West to continue with Islamization, nor that your actions contribute to it.
",-1
"Where then would we go to seek refuge?
",-1
"The signatories plea is that the pope will “quickly convene a synod on the dangers of Islam.”

",-1
"Swedish police told the Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet that the gang is trying to build a presence in both Malmö and Helsingborg.

"Congressman: ""Credible Evidence"" Of “Terrorist Infiltration Through the Southern Border” Related To Las Vegas Shooting
",-1
"We have had the Islamic State claim over and over that they were taking credit for the mass shooting that took place in Las Vegas on October 1, 2017, and that Stephen Paddock was a recent convert to Islam.
",-1
"If you recall, the Islamic State has never claimed responsibility for attacks they were not involved in.
",-1
"Here are just a few of those claims.
",-1

",-1
"On Thursday evening, Representative Scott Perry (R-PA) appeared on Tucker Carlson tonight and said that he has evidence that the Islamic State may be telling the truth and that they may actually have been involved in the deadly attack.
",-1
"Perry brought up the fact that we can't seem to get information in the case that the public needs to be made aware of, something that was brought up in a district courtroom earlier this week.
",-1
"Additionally, the family of Stephen Paddock just received his cremated remains on Thursday and his brother said that the family has yet to receive an autopsy report.
",-1
"Why is that?
",-1
"Everyone who was killed that night had autopsies and those have been released.
",-1
"We're told Paddock shot himself in the head, right?
",-1
"Why would the autopsy report be something that needs to be withheld from the public or his family?
",-1
"""Twice before the attack, ISIS warned the United States they would attack Las Vegas,"" he added.
",-1
"""In June and August.""
",-1
"""And then after the attack claimed responsibility four times,"" Perry continued.
",-1
"""I’m just telling you I have received what I feel to be and believe to be credible evidence of a possible terrorist nexus,"" Perry said.
",-1
"The investigation has been conducted by local and state police, not the feds, and yet, they continue to claim there is not Islamic terrorist involvement.
",-1
"Yet, though they claim that Paddock was a lone gunman, they continue to withhold video of him in Mandalay Bay because they are still investigating other suspects to charge in the shooting.
",-1
"And no one seems to know where alleged Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos is either.
",-1
"None of this is really that surprising.
",-1
"If you recall, we reported on Islamic terrorists settling into Mexico and crossing the border some years back and that came out as the infamous ""Gang of Eight"" were working on an immigration deal and had rejected building the 700 miles of double-tier border fencing Congress authorized just seven years ago, with a majority of the Senate saying they didn't want to delay granting illegal immigrants legal status while the fence was being built.
",-1
"Three years prior to that report, there was a video report that seems to have provided a bit of evidence to the claim that Islamists were crossing our southern border.
",-1
"In fact, DHS had denied Muslim terrorists were crossing the border, but a local investigator produced evidence to the contrary.
",-1
"Reports indicated that some jihadis were paying as much as $50,000 to get across the border.
",-1
"This has been documented for several years now.
",-1
"It's not surprising.

"What is surprising is the level of secrecy surrounding the Las Vegas shooting and the containment of information more than three months after it occurred.

"And one lawmaker is hinting that the government is covering up a big story about terrorism.

"During an appearance with Tucker Carlson on Fox, Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) said he’s seen credible evidence that ISIS was involved in the devastating Las Vegas shooting.
",-1
"ISIS terrorists, he said, infiltrated the U.S. via the southern border prior to the attack blamed on alleged lone gunman Stephen Paddock.
",-1
"“Recently I have been made aware of what I believe to be credible evidence, credible information regarding potential terrorist infiltration through the southern border regarding this incident,” Perry said.
",-1
"Perry added that ISIS warnings of a forthcoming attack on Las Vegas prior to the shooting make a terror link even more likely.
",-1
"“Well, they could be–lets face it, ISIS twice before the attack, ISIS warned the United States that they would attack Las Vegas in June and August after the attack claimed responsibility four times.
",-1
"An incredulous Carlson asked fellow guest Catherine Lombardo, a lawyer representing families affected by the tragedy, about the law enforcement investigation into the shooting.
",-1
"“The FBI and the Las Vegas metro police department have been conducting the investigation, ” she said.
",-1
"“We’ve seen no evidence of a terrorist attack, and I will ask with all due respect, congressman, unless have you specific evidence to back that up, it seems a bit irresponsible to make that allegation so, if you do, or make that assertion, if do you have any evidence of that, I’m asking you right now to share it with us and tell us what that is.
",-1
"“We’ve all been waiting, and I’m waiting, too.
",-1
"Like I said, nothing adds up, but I’m just telling you, I have received what I feel to be and believe to be credible evidence of a possible terrorist nexus, and we’re gonna have to wait… until the situation develops,” he said.
",-1
"The lawmaker said he wants the nation’s counterterror agencies involved in the investigation.
",-1
"“If ISIS warns about an attack and then an attack occurs and claims responsibility after the fact, it seems to me that at a minimum, they should have some portion of the investigation to clearly debunk that claim and, yet, it hasn’t happened,” he said.

"Pope Francis accused victims of Chile’s most notorious pedophile of slander Thursday, an astonishing end to a visit meant to help heal the wounds of a sex abuse scandal that has cost the Catholic Church its credibility in the country.
",-1
"Francis said that until he sees proof that Bishop Juan Barros was complicit in covering up the sex crimes of the Rev.
",-1
"They noted the accusers were deemed credible enough by the Vatican that it sentenced Karadima to a lifetime of “penance and prayer” for his crimes in 2011.
",-1
"A Chilean judge also found the victims to be credible, saying that while she had to drop criminal charges against Karadima because too much time had passed, proof of his crimes wasn’t lacking.
",-1
"[…] The Karadima scandal dominated Francis’ visit to Chile and the overall issue of sex abuse and church cover-up was likely to factor into his three-day trip to Peru that began late Thursday.

"One of the victims made clear his disgust at Pope Francis for essentially covering up for a man who watched as another bishop sexually abused him.

",-1
"and LVMPD have failed to record the death of at least one shooting victim killed in the massacre
",-1
"LAS VEGAS (INTELLIHUB) — The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have failed to catalogue at least one deceased victim of the 1 October massacre which reportedly only left 58 people dead.
",-1
"The woman’s lifeless body can be seen being drug across the parking lot by several men who placed the body behind a pick-up truck while the gunfire continued.
",-1
"The event was reported by Intellihub’s Shepard Ambellas on Nov. 11, 2017, in the article titled Private surveillance footage reveals “helicopter hovering overhead” at time of Las Vegas Massacre, FBI never asked for tape, after an excerpt of the footage aired on Tucker Carlson Tonight.
",-1
"At 10:16 p.m., two men drag a “fallen victim” across the parking lot.
",-1
"The men position the victim behind a Ford pickup truck, presumably to shield themselves and the victim from taking any further incoming rounds as they attempted to give the victim medical assistance.
",-1
"“Later at ten-twenty-four p.m., one of the men places his shirt across the victim’s face and then at ten-thirty-two a man places what appears to be a blanket or towel over the body after they had given up hope,” Tucker Carlson said.
",-1
"“Police only arrive in this area for the first time around ten-forty-five p.m. when the body is still there.” The victim’s body was eventually was loaded into the back of a Ford Raptor pickup truck at 11:50 p.m. and taken away.
",-1
"Astonishingly, between the times of 10:13 p.m. and 10:16 p.m. a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera which Carlson claims is from a “helicopter hovering overhead.” A quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m., several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen.
",-1
"According to Carlson, the owner of the tape maintains that law enforcement investigators have never asked to see the footage.
",-1
"However, the official report failed to catalogue the dead woman who was shot in the parking lot of a Haven Street business.
",-1
"The following image is taken from page 34 of the LVMPD preliminary report which shows the seven victims and their locations of death numbered in yellow.
",-1
"The next photo shows where the unnamed victim was located.

"The victim can be seen being dragged in the following video.
",-1
"The following day, several men, one of which presumably was Fox News anchor Sean Hannity (who was heavily guarded by a five-man security team), received mobile haircuts in the very same parking lot, in nearly the same spot the victim’s body was dragged to.

"SPECIAL REPORT: Pope Francis Accused of Inaction in Notorious Sex Abuse Cases
",-1
"There is not a single piece of evidence against him.
",-1
"It is all calumny.
",-1
"Is that clear?”
",-1
"Writing for the Boston Globe, the paper that first broke the clerical sex abuse scandals all the way back in 2001, Kevin Cullen wrote, “Let the record show that the promise of Pope Francis died in Santiago, Chile, on Jan. 18, in the year of our Lord 2018… he has revealed himself like no one else could.”
",-1
"But it gets worse than this.
",-1
"Though he’s “sticking with Francis” for now, Winters wrote, “I wish I knew what it was about Pope Francis that makes him fail to grasp the situation with Bishop Barros, the pain caused to the victims and the damage done to the church.
",-1
"On January 23rd, an unsigned NCR editorial opined, “Within the space of four days, Pope Francis twice slandered abuse survivors.”
",-1
"“These remarks are at the least shameful.
",-1
"At the most, they suggest that Francis now could be complicit in the cover-up.
",-1
"The script is all too familiar: Discredit the survivors’ testimony, support the prelate in question, and bank on public attention moving on to something else.
",-1
"“The insistence with which Francis defends Barros is mystifying.
",-1
"Three separate journalists on the papal flight gave the pope opportunity to say why exactly he believed the bishop instead of the survivors accusing him.
",-1
"The second journalist to ask Francis about Barros on the flight was a Chilean woman.
",-1
"She asked: ‘Why are not the victims’ testimonies proof for you?
",-1
"Why do you not believe them?’ The pope gave no satisfying answer, only repeating a claim of ‘no evidence’ against the bishop.”
",-1
"Indeed, it was understood, as the Washington Post said, that Francis’ trip to Latin America – dogged by protests over Barros both in person at the pope’s appearances and in the press – was in part intended as “an apology tour” to abuse survivors.
",-1
"Which is why his accusation of calumny against those same victims the next day came as such a shock to observers unused to Bergoglio’s ability to turn on a dime.
",-1
"All was going as planned.
",-1
"On Wednesday, January 17, the pope met as scheduled with selected survivors of sexual abuse by priests.
",-1
"He made all the right noises, talking about his “pain and shame,” and reportedly even crying, at what happened.
",-1
"24 hours later he was calling them liars.
",-1
"James Hamilton, 49 and now a doctor, was one of the Barros accusers.
",-1
"He told the BBC at a press conference, “What the Pope has done today is offensive and painful, and not only against us, but against everyone seeking to end the abuses.” The lead voice of the victims in Chile, Juan Carlos Cruz, tweeting to one of Francis’s leading apologists, Austen Ivereigh, said, “Does he need a photo, a selfie, as proof?
",-1
"Sorry Austen, we didn’t think of it as we were being abused and Juan Barros watching.”
",-1
"Although the issue came to the attention of a much broader audience during the most recent papal trip, the outcry has been ongoing since his appointment to the southern Chilean diocese of Osorno in 2015.
",-1
"Barros claimed in court that the first he knew of Karadima’s offenses was on a Chilean television programme in 2010.
",-1
"This is refuted by Karadima’s victims – deemed credible both by the secular courts and the Vatican tribunal – who testified that he personally witnessed the abuse at Sacred Heart of Jesus church in Santiago.
",-1
"Last Thursday, however, was not the first time Francis, confronted unexpectedly in public over the Barros question, has responded testily and with insults.
",-1
"In 2015 the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano published a video of him scolding two women who spoke with him in St. Peter’s Piazza, asking that he reconsider the appointment, citing the “suffering” of the Church in Chile over the issue.
",-1
"The insults were not forgotten.
",-1
"The jab certainly wasn’t lost on Francis, since the signs were being held by protesters the full length of his auto route to Santiago from the airport.
",-1
"One of the protesters told the BBC, “He doesn’t even know us, so how can he accuse us of being such things?
",-1
"He thinks we are politically motivated even though we come from different parishes in Osorno and are doing this because we are against priests being allowed to abuse children.”
",-1
"This also followed an astonishing public rebuke of the pope by Sean Cardinal O’Malley – a member of the C9 council of cardinals and the former head of the pope’s sex abuse commission – who said, “It is understandable that Pope Francis’ statements yesterday in Santiago, Chile were a source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse by clergy or any other perpetrator.”
",-1
"Of course, Francis being Francis the apology was banked around with assertions of how right he was.
",-1
"“I have to ask forgiveness because the word ‘proof’ wounded,” he said.
",-1
"“It wounded many people who were abused…I ask them for forgiveness because I wounded them without realizing it, but it was an unintended wound.
",-1
"“And I know how much they suffer, to feel that the Pope says in their face ‘bring me a letter, a proof.’ It’s a slap.
",-1
"And I agree that my expression was not apt, because I didn’t think.”
",-1
"He doubled down, saying, “I have not heard any victim of Barros.
",-1
"They did not come, they did not show themselves, they did not give evidence in court.
",-1
"It is true that Barros was in Karadima’s group of young people.
",-1
"But let us be clear: if you accuse someone without evidence with pertinacity, that is calumny.”
",-1
"“This is what I can say with sincerity.
",-1
"Barros will remain there if I don’t find a way to condemn him.
",-1
"I cannot condemn him if I don’t have – I don’t say proof – but evidence.
",-1
"And there are many ways to get evidence.
",-1
"This “contrite” papal apology didn’t fly well even with the regular news reporters.
",-1
"Indeed, Francis claim that he met with and heard the “pain” of the victims is untrue in the specific case in hand.
",-1
"CBS News reports that though the Osorno group had tried to obtain a meeting during the trip they were refused.
",-1
"Greg Burke, the pope’s press officer, confirmed that “no papal meetings were planned with the Osorno group, which had formally requested to meet with the pope in July but were told by Vatican organizers that his schedule was already final, some six months before the trip.”
",-1
"Who is Barros?
",-1
"Some may remember a video that made the internet rounds of an uproar in a Chilean cathedral at the installation ceremony of a bishop.
",-1
"At the time it didn’t draw much attention from the English language press – mostly at that time distracted by the ongoing battle of the notorious Kasper Proposal and the oncoming Synods.
",-1
"But despite the pope’s claim, the charges against Barros are serious and have been deemed credible by a judge.
",-1
"He is accused of having covered up sexual abuse, including destroying evidence, committed by Karadima in the ‘80s and ‘90s.
",-1
"In fact – and this point has tended to get glossed over in the press – Barros is accused by the victims of having been in the room, watching at the time, and of engaging in sexual activity with Karadima.
",-1
"Juan Carlos Cruz, told the press in 2015 that he and another boy – both in their teens at the time – “would lie down on the priest’s [Karadima’s] bed, one resting his head at the man’s shoulder, another sitting near his feet.
",-1
"The priest would kiss the boys and grope them, he said, all while the Rev.
",-1
"Juan Barros watched.” Cruz, now a 51-year-old “gay” journalist, told The Associated Press, “Barros was there, and he saw it all.”
",-1
"Things are a bit different now.
",-1
"Neither was the complaint against Barros without the support of responsible people.
",-1
"The media reported that over 1,300 Catholic faithful in Osorno, including 30 priests of the diocese and 51 members of Parliament, wrote to the pope asking him to rescind the appointment – none of which received any response.
",-1
"Peter Kleigel, a priest of Osorno, told Associated Press, “We’re convinced that this appointment is not correct because, following canon law, a bishop must be well-regarded.
",-1
"We need a bishop who’s credible.”
",-1
"The problem with getting the news out about Karadima, as in most of these cases, was the bishop, in this case Cardinal Francisco Javier Errázuriz of Santiago, who after the Conclave of 2013 was appointed a member of Pope Francis’s C9 inner council.
",-1
"Allegations against Karadima – that went back to 1962 – had certainly been reported to Church authorities well before a Chilean news agency revealed the case in 2010, but were ignored by Errázuriz.
",-1
"Even the National Catholic Reporter in 2014 pointed to the cover up and the relationship between the new pope and the accused cardinals,
",-1
"“Hamilton had applied for a marriage annulment, after telling his wife of a long psychosexual entanglement with Karadima that began when he was 17 in El Bosque.
",-1
"His wife confided in a priest, who told Errázuriz in 2006.
",-1
"When a canon lawyer and several priests close to the cardinal suggested that Hamilton not mention Karadima, he pressed on with his request in order to force the issue of punishment for the priest while having his marriage annulled.
",-1
"Again, Errázuriz refused to take action against Karadima.”
",-1
"The pope’s claim that there is “no evidence” flies in the face of the ruling of the civil judge in the Karadima case – a fact that ought to be of paramount consideration under the Vatican’s own rules for determining credibility in such cases.
",-1
"While Judge Jessica Gonzalez was forced to drop criminal charges because the statute of limitations had expired, she affirmed that testimony by Cruz and other victims was credible.
",-1
"After a full year of investigation, Gonzalez called their claims “truthful and reliable”.
",-1
"Victims said that a letter written to Church authorities complaining of Karadima’s abuse in 1982 was intercepted and destroyed by Barros, who was serving at the time as secretary to Cardinal Francisco Fresno, Errázuriz’s successor and collaborator.
",-1
"As for Barros’s general credibility as a Catholic bishop, the witness of the victims is damning.
",-1
"In a letter to Bishop Ivo Scapolo, papal nuncio to Chile, that Cruz gave to the Associated Press, he said he witnessed Karadima and Barros in an intimate relationship.
",-1
"“I saw Karadima and Juan Barros kissing and touching each other.
",-1
"The groping generally came from Karadima touching Barros’ genitals”.
",-1
"Barros has never denied having had a close friendship with Karadima.
",-1
"Hamilton confirmed this saying, “I saw how Barros watched it all.”
",-1
"And the matter didn’t end in 2010.
",-1
"Which brings us to Francis Bergoglio’s own record in this area.
",-1
"The pope claimed “I am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes,” but this claim is not supported by the reality.
",-1
"Indeed, it has been pointed out that Francis has gone to considerable lengths to dismantle the efforts of his predecessor at “safeguarding” young people, punishing abusers and removing bishops who cover it up.
",-1
"In the case of Barros, the Associated Press obtained a confidential letter from Pope Francis dated 2015 that “reveals the [Chilean] bishops’ concern about Francis naming a Karadima protégé, Bishop Juan Barros.” Just days before the pope’s “calumny” comment, January 11, AP reported that Francis had full knowledge of the controversy he risked in appointing Barros to Osorno.
",-1
"“[H]is ambassador in Chile had tried to find a way to contain the damage well before the case made headlines.”
",-1
"The letter, addressed to the executive committee of the Chilean bishops’ conference, said, “Thank you for having openly demonstrated the concern that you have about the appointment of Monsignor Juan Barros.
",-1
"I understand what you’re telling me and I’m aware that the situation of the church in Chile is difficult due to the trials you’ve had to undergo.” The letter said that in 2014 the nuncio, Archbishop Scapolo, had asked Barros to resign as bishop of the armed forces and had “encouraged him to take a sabbatical year before assuming any other pastoral responsibility as a bishop.”
",-1
"There can also be little doubt the new pope was fully aware of the record of his close friend Cardinal Errázuriz in ignoring complaints of Karadima’s victims when he appointed him to the C9 council.
",-1
"And even if he didn’t then, he certainly knows now, and yet Errazuriz continues in that advisory role.
",-1
"Francis further appointed Cardinal Errázuriz to serve as his Special Envoy to World Apostolic Congress Of Mercy III meeting in Bogotá, Colombia in June 2014.
",-1
"Since 2001, Cardinal Ratzinger and later as Pope Benedict installed effective procedural reforms on clerical sexual abuse; Francis in his short five years has all but completely dismantled or reversed those changes.
",-1
"Danneels’s prominence in the Bergoglian pontificate continues to be the most prominent indicator of the pope’s deprioritising of clerical sexual abuse.
",-1
"At the end of a long career as Europe’s leading “liberal” Catholic prelate, Danneels came under a cloud of scandal when he was accused of having covered for a protégé bishop who admitted to having sexually abused his own minor nephew.
",-1
"In 2010 the publication of an audio recording determined undeniably that Danneels had told the victim to keep quiet and not cause trouble for the soon-to-retire Bishop Roger Vangheluwe of Bruges.
",-1
"The cardinal even went so far as to suggest that the victim should “ask forgiveness” for his own role in the scandal.
",-1
"Before the recordings were released, Danneels had also denied all knowledge of sexual abuse by clergy or cover-ups.
",-1
"Maciel Degollado, founder of the Legionaries of Christ.
",-1
"Crucially, it was Ratzinger who moved the competence for sex abuse cases from the Congregation for Bishops to Doctrine of the Faith, with powers to suspend and punish offenders.
",-1
"His reforms specifically included bishops who had refused to act against priest-abusers.
",-1
"A senior member of the Vatican’s diplomatic corps, Archbishop Miguel Maury Buendia, confirmed this, saying, “This Pope has removed two or three bishops per month throughout the world...
",-1
"There have been two or three instances in which they said no, and so the Pope simply removed them.”
",-1
"These reforms – and removals – have ceased entirely under Francis.
",-1
"Inzoli was found guilty in 2012 by an ecclesiastical court of abusing boys as young as twelve and suspended.
",-1
"Following an appeal by Coccopalmerio, Francis reduced the priest’s penalty to a “lifetime of prayer,” with permission to say Mass privately, and a promise to stay away from children.
",-1
"The uproar over this caused the Italian prosecutors to reopen the case against the priest, and eventually Inzoli went to prison and was laicized.
",-1
"As for Ratzinger/Benedict’s procedural reforms, rumours continue to circulate that the pope intends to reverse them as well, placing competence back into the hands of the same dicastery that held it when the scandals broke in 2001.
",-1
"A tribunal of bishops, requested by his own sex abuse commission, was ignored and then Francis summarily removed two of the CDF staffers in charge of handling such cases, famously refusing to give any reasons to CDF prefect Cardinal Müller who was soon to be dismissed.
",-1
"Marie Collins, an Irish abuse survivor, was appointed in 2014 to the new Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors.
",-1
"She resigned in 2017, citing “Vatican officials’ reluctance to cooperate with its work to protect children.” Collins released a damning statement, indicating that the commission had never seriously intended to change or reform anything.
",-1
"She said none of the commission’s recommendations had been implemented.
",-1
"As of December last year, the commission has been allowed to lapse, and no longer functions, though it has not been definitively dissolved.
",-1
"The terms of office of its members expired December 17th.
",-1
"This week Collins tweeted her question for Pope Francis on the Chilean situation: “Why does the Pope not believe these three men?
",-1
"They have been consistent over years in what they say.
",-1
"When asked why he believes his fellow cleric and not the survivors he can give no good reason.”
",-1
"Why indeed.

",-1
"""He said he was going to go put on a light show.
",-1
"And I can't remember whether he said for or with his friends, but that's what he did say,"" Haig said.
",-1
"But newly released search warrant records filed last fall by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department say Haig ""may have conspired with Stephen Paddock to commit murder with a deadly weapon.""
",-1
"Haig strongly denies that.
",-1
"""I felt that they were hoping that they could find a connection between myself and Paddock, that would go back showing that I supplied him with most of his ammunition, possibly even some firearms,"" Haig said.
",-1
"""They're not gonna find it.
",-1
"I talked to the guy three times.""
",-1
"It's unclear whether Haig is still a person of interest, but he was the only one mentioned by name in the search warrant, other than Marilou Danley - Paddock's girlfriend.
",-1
"Authorities have since said they don't plan to bring charges against Danley.

"Lawyer: Ammo dealer saw nothing suspicious in Vegas gunman
",-1
"Douglas Haig had no reason to believe Stephen Paddock would launch the Oct. 1 shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people, attorney Marc Victor said.
",-1
"He said Haig wishes he could have figured out the intentions of Paddock but defends the sale of ammunition as legal.
",-1
"""He wishes there was some clue that could have identified him,"" Victor said.
",-1
"""There was just nothing.""
",-1
"Meanwhile, the coroner in Las Vegas started releasing redacted autopsy records about the 58 people killed in the mass shooting at an outdoor concert.
",-1
"Records relating to Paddock were not being provided.
",-1
"The records were released Wednesday in response to a public records lawsuit filed by The Associated Press and Las Vegas Review-Journal.
",-1
"Haig was named as a ""person of interest"" in the investigation by mistake Tuesday when court documents were released nearly four months after the shooting.
",-1
"The documents did not disclose why authorities considered Haig a person of interest, and officials haven't said whether he has since been cleared of that designation.
",-1
"Victor said his client sold ammunition to Paddock once and doesn't believe they have communicated since.
",-1
"Las Vegas police and officials with the FBI, U.S. attorney's office in Nevada and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives each declined Wednesday to comment about Haig or the investigation.
",-1
"A law enforcement official told The Associated Press in October that Paddock bought 1,000 rounds of tracer ammunition from a private seller he met at a Phoenix gun show three weeks before the shooting.
",-1
"The official spoke anonymously because they weren't authorized to disclose case information.
",-1
"Tracer bullets contain a pyrotechnic charge that illuminates the path of fired bullets so shooters can see whether their aim is correct.
",-1
"Haig told the AP on Tuesday that he sold unspecified ammunition to Paddock.
",-1
"He also told ""CBS This Morning"" on Wednesday that he sold more than 700 rounds of ammunition to Paddock.
",-1
"""I couldn't detect anything wrong with this guy,"" he said of Paddock.
",-1
"The ammunition sale took place at Haig's home in Mesa, because he didn't have all the ammunition on hand that Paddock wanted while at the gun show.
",-1
"Victor said a box that Paddock used to carry ammunition out of Haig's house and bore his client's name was later found in the Las Vegas hotel where the attack was launched.
",-1
"It's unknown whether the ammunition Haig sold to Paddock was used in the attack.
",-1
"The lawyer said the type and quantity of ammunition Paddock bought from his client wasn't unusual.
",-1
"Robert Spitzer, an expert on firearms and the Second Amendment, said by and large there are no restrictions on the amount of ammunition a person can buy, but a large sale of tracer ammunition would certainly be unusual.
",-1
"Only six states in the U.S. have laws requiring that ammunition buyers pass a background check.
",-1
"Arizona and Nevada do not have such a requirement, nor do they mandate that dealers keep a record of ammunition transactions.
",-1
"""If you are in the business of selling anything, you are usually happy to make the sale, and there's nothing that says you need to write down this person's name or report the sale,"" said Spitzer, who is the chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland.
",-1
"Victor said his client has cooperated with investigators who contacted him within 24 hours of the shooting and has spoken to them probably four or five times, though he hasn't talked to them in months.
",-1
"Haig describes himself as a senior engineer for Honeywell Aerospace in his biography on the professional and social media platform LinkedIn.
",-1
"Records show Haig also owns Specialized Military Ammunition LLC.
",-1
"The company's website says it sold tracer and incendiary ammunition but is now ""closed indefinitely.""
",-1
"Haig's name was blacked out in the more than 270 pages of search warrant records released by a Nevada judge to the AP, but remained on one page of documents provided to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
",-1
"The newspaper published the name online.
",-1
"Clark County District Court Judge Elissa Cadish later ordered the full document not be published without redactions, but she acknowledged she couldn't order the newspaper to retract the name.

",-1
"But they aren't sure how long they can expect the mission to last once the lander and rover arrive—it could be over in as little as two weeks, ending as soon as the sun sets, since the mission runs on solar power and the polar area is quite shadowy even during the day.

"Coroner Defies Court Order: Won't Release Las Vegas Shooter's Autopsy Report
",-1
"Clark County Nevada Coroner John Fudenberg has determined to defy a court order from a district court judge to release the autopsy report of Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock.
",-1
"Though the order was issued on Tuesday, Fudenberg conferred with others and seems determined to not release the autopsy report until, as he said, it is ""finalized,"" The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported, which sued for the autopsy report.
",-1
"The body has been cremated!
",-1
"The family finally got the remains in a box marked ""evidence"" over three months after the shooting and the autopsy report hasn't been finalized?
",-1
"Wait, were the same guys in the autopsy room that were there when the doctors and coroners examined John F Kennedy ?
",-1
"“I don’t believe this is consistent with what the court ordered,” said Las Vegas attorney Maggie McLetchie, who represents the Las Vegas Review-Journal and The Associated Press in their November action demanding the release of the reports.
",-1
"“They (the coroner’s office) have delayed this for too long, and whatever stage the coroner’s report on Paddock is in, it should be provided to the Review-Journal and Associated Press without further delay.
",-1
"Release the records.”
",-1
"“The court correctly recognized the presumption of public access to records, even when a mass tragedy occurs,” McLetchie added.
",-1
"“(The judge) also rejected arguments by the coroner’s office that there were any privacy interests with regards to the autopsy of Stephen Paddock, let alone any that outweighed the strong presumption of access to records in Nevada.”
",-1
"“The shooter’s body was cremated Dec. 21,"" said Review-Journal Editor-in-Chief Keith Moyer added.
",-1
"The law is squarely on the side of the public’s right to open government.”
",-1
"That's exactly right!
",-1
"Something is rotten in Denmark!
",-1
"McLetchie has been trying to obtain as much information for the public as possible, including video of Paddock at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino.
",-1
"However, she has been told by Las Vegas Metro Police Department attornies that they can't release that information until they finalize their investigation into other suspects which may also produce charges in the case.
",-1
"“The coroner’s office has fought to keep autopsy reports confidential,” the Review-Journal.
",-1
"The coroner was ordered on January 11 to pay nearly $32,000 in legal costs to the Review-Journal because it refused to release public records.
",-1
"While the preliminary report indicated the Paddock died of a gun shot wound to the head through the mouth, it's all the details that aren't given that seem to be problematic for the coroner to release.

",-1
"Moreover, against public law, the coroner has still not released the autopsy report for “Stephen Paddock” after an Intellihub article definitively proved the body recovered in Mandalay Bay room 32-135 was not Paddock’s.

"Trump Effect: Islamic Republic Ceases Naval Provocations in Arabian Gulf
",-1
"Nowhere was this more evident than in the manner in which Trump described Iran’s repressive regime and attempts by the Iranian people to overthrow it through peaceful protest.
",-1
"When it comes to Iran’s governing authorities, the Trump administration is under no illusions about the nefarious nature of this fascist theocracy.
",-1
"“We are restoring clarity about our adversaries,” Trump stated in a not too subtle jibe at his predecessor who seemed to be in a perpetual state of confusion about who his friends and enemies were.
",-1
"Trump also referenced the recent widespread Iranian protests, crushed with extreme ruthlessness by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij auxiliary militia.
",-1
"“When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of a corrupt dictatorship,” he stated, “I did not stay silent.
",-1
"America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.”
",-1
"His administration remained largely silent when Iranians took to the streets in 2009 to protest a rigged election.
",-1
"Some have speculated that his administration missed out on a prime opportunity for regime change.
",-1
"It was only downhill from there.
",-1
"He tried selling the American people on the naïve notion that there were moderate elements of import in the Iranian government, ignoring the obvious fact that all authority in Iran is vested with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and his IRGC henchmen.
",-1
"Ransom payments to the tune of $1.7 billion were transferred to Iran.
",-1
"Promising criminal investigations targeting Iran’s chief terror proxy, Hezbollah, were shut down.
",-1
"Targeted liquidation operations by our Israeli allies against Iranian Quds Force leaders were foiled after Obama tipped off Tehran on Israel’s intentions.
",-1
"Iranian material breaches of the JCPOA were all but ignored while Iran’s ballistic missile program was allowed to proceed at full speed despite being in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231.
",-1
"Iran regards the Arabian Gulf as its domain and but for the presence of the U.S. 5th Fleet, would have full reign over its waters, which include the strategic Strait of Hormuz.
",-1
"In addition to securing the Gulf, the 5th Fleet serves as a constant reminder to the Iranians of their impotence.
",-1
"On his watch, American warships patrolling the Gulf were harried by armed IRGC speed boats and larger navy frigates with near impunity.
",-1
"At times Iranian naval vessels closed to within 600 to 150 yards of American warships.
",-1
"Iranian arrogance and impudence reached its zenith with the January 12th 2016 seizure of two American riverine command boats and their crews near Farsi Island.
",-1
"The RCBs and crews manning them were returned some 16 hours later but not before the Iranians stole two satellite phone sim cards, likely containing classified information, as well as thousands of pages of information downloaded from laptops, GPS devices and maps used by the sailors.
",-1
"Ironically, the seizure occurred on the very day that Obama was to give his State of the Union address but predictably, he didn’t think that the seizure of Americans was important enough to note.
",-1
"But according to the Navy, the past five months have witnessed markedly less belligerent conduct from the Iranians, leaving Navy officials baffled by the sudden positive change in attitude.
",-1
"In fact, Iran’s attitude adjustment in the Arabian Gulf is no mystery and stems from the Trump administration’s implementation of a new robust foreign policy vis-à-vis the Islamic Republic.
",-1
"Soon after taking office, Trump noted that “Iran [was] playing with fire” and added that he wouldn’t be as “kind” to the mullahs as Obama was.
",-1
"It was backed up by tangible action.
",-1
"Additional sanctions were imposed against Iran for acting in defiance of UNSCR 2231.
",-1
"Sanctions were also imposed against the IRGC for supporting terrorism.
",-1
"Trump’s DOJ revived and breathed new life into Project Cassandra, a promising anti-Hezbollah/IRGC law enforcement initiative shelved by Obama.
",-1
"Most importantly, Trump failed to certify the JCPOA noting material Iranian breaches, and has threatened to abrogate the deal in its entirety unless modifications are implemented.
",-1
"Those modifications would include an end to absurd sunset clauses in the JCPOA and tough restrictions on ballistic missile testing.

"Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge
",-1
"(CNN) Douglas Haig, an Arizona man who says he sold tracer ammunition to the gunman in October's Las Vegas massacre, was arrested Friday on a charge of conspiring to manufacture and sell another type of ammunition -- armor-piercing bullets -- in violation of federal law.
",-1
"A criminal complaint alleges two unfired .308-caliber (7.62mm) rounds found in gunman Stephen Paddock's hotel room had Haig's fingerprints on them as well as tool marks from his workshop.
",-1
"The bullets in the cartridges were armor-piercing, with an incendiary capsule in the nose, the complaint says.
",-1
"The FBI on October 19 searched Haig's Mesa home and seized ammunition the agency says is armor-piercing, the complaint said.
",-1
"Haig did not have a license to manufacture armor-piercing ammunition, documents said.
",-1
"Police say Paddock, 64, opened fire on October 1 from his 32nd-floor room at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay hotel onto a crowd attending a music festival, killing 58 people and shooting and injuring 422 others.
",-1
"More than 850 others suffered other injuries in the attack.
",-1
"Investigators say Paddock died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.
",-1
"Douglas Haig's name was revealed in the release of search warrant records.
",-1
"Haig, 55, appeared in court Friday and was released on his own recognizance with specific conditions not spelled out in court proceedings.
",-1
"He is due in court again February 15 for a preliminary hearing.
",-1
"The maximum penalty for manufacturing illegal ammunition is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
",-1
"Haig's attorney, Marc J. Victor, told CNN he had no comment.
",-1
"CNN affiliate KNXV caught up with Victor outside court, and the lawyer said he couldn't say anything because of the ongoing case.
",-1
"""My first obligation and only obligation is to my client,"" he told KNXV.
",-1
"The complaint
",-1
"Haig was publicly linked to the Las Vegas investigation Tuesday when a judge unsealed months-old police search warrant records that named him as a person of interest
",-1
"In a Friday morning news conference before his arrest, Haig, responding to the documents' release, said he sold tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after they met at a gun show.
",-1
"Tracer ammunition has a pyrotechnic charge that, when fired, leaves an illuminated trace that can help a shooter have a more precise idea of where the bullet is going.
",-1
"Haig did not describe the ammunition as armor-piercing.
",-1
"Victor, at the same news conference at his Phoenix-area office, said the tracer ammunition that Haig sold Paddock ""was not modified in any way ... from manufacturer's specs.""
",-1
"But in Friday's criminal complaint, investigators say Haig and an associate also claimed they sold to Paddock other ammunition -- four or five 10-round packages of .308-caliber incendiary ammunition -- at a Las Vegas gun show in August.
",-1
"It's not clear from the complaint whether the two armor-piercing rounds with the incendiary capsule are from the packages Haig allegedly told investigators he sold Paddock at the gun show.
",-1
"The complaint also does not say whether Paddock fired any of the ammunition that he bought from Haig.

",-1
"Haig, an aerospace engineer and part-time ammunition reseller, said at Friday's news conference that he never saw anything suspicious in his brief interactions with Paddock.

",-1
"He held Friday's news conference to protect his reputation, he and his attorney said.
",-1
"They gave the following timeline:
",-1
"• Paddock first approached Haig's table at a Las Vegas gun show sometime last year but met another person who was behind the table.
",-1
"• Haig first met Paddock at a subsequent Phoenix gun show, where he was selling ammunition.
",-1
"• Paddock took Haig's business card because the seller didn't have the quantity of trace ammunition that he wanted.
",-1
"• Paddock later called Haig three times to arrange a sale at Haig's home.
",-1
"• In September, Paddock arrived at Haig's home, bought the tracer ammunition and drove away.
",-1
"The ammunition, he said, was:
",-1
"• 600 rounds of 7.62mm NATO, M62, tracer ammunition, manufactured by the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri.
",-1
"• 120 rounds of 5.56mm M196 tracer ammunition, manufactured by the same plant.
",-1
"He said the 5.56mm rounds were in their original packaging.
",-1
"He did not comment on the 7.62mm rounds' packaging.

"Before the sale, Paddock told him ""that he was going to go out to the desert and put on a light show"" with the ammunition -- that he was ""going to go out and shoot it at night with friends.""
",-1
"Seller's reaction to massacre: 'Revulsion'

"Victor said police found his client's name and address on a box that Paddock had -- a box that Haig gave him to carry the tracer rounds he had bought.

"""Revulsion,"" Haig said of his reaction.

"""It's been not a lot of fun, quite frankly.""
",-1
"Haig added, ""I had no contribution to what Paddock did.
",-1
"Haig named as person of interest
",-1
"A Nevada judge on Tuesday unsealed police search warrant records -- prepared shortly after the shooting -- that mentioned two persons of interest in the case.
",-1
"The judge released the documents after CNN and other media outlets sued to obtain them.

"One person of interest, whom police had named previously, was the killer's girlfriend, Marilou Danley.
",-1
"Authorities subsequently cleared her publicly.
",-1
"The second name was redacted.
",-1
"But the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported it had a version of the search warrant that named, without redaction, Haig as that second person.
",-1
"The documents didn't explain why he was a person of interest.
",-1
"Las Vegas police officials told CNN the department couldn't comment on Haig or any names, and referred questions to federal authorities.
",-1
"Sheriff has said feds were investigating someone
",-1
"When the search warrant documents were released this week, Clark County District Court Judge Elissa Cadish allowed a small portion of those records to be redacted because ""there is an ongoing investigation regarding charges against another individual, arising out of information obtained in connection with the ... shooting, but not directly related to the shooting.""
",-1
"In response to a question from CNN in January, the Clark County sheriff, Joe Lombardo, said federal authorities are investigating a person in the case.
",-1
"That person could face federal charges not directly related to the shooting within the next 60 days, the sheriff said January 19.
",-1
"Lombardo didn't disclose the person's name, saying those details were ""under federal grand jury disclosure"" rules.
",-1
"On Friday morning, before his arrest, Haig answered a reporter's question about whether he believed he was that person.

"""No.

"Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith
",-1
"NewsCatholic Church, Family, Marriage
",-1
"ROME, February 2, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) —His Excellency Marian Eleganti, auxiliary bishop of Chur in Switzerland, today added his name to the “Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage,” bringing the total number of signatories to eight bishops and one cardinal, LifeSite has confirmed.
",-1
"Bishop Eleganti’s support of the profession comes just three days after Bishop Athanasius Schneider, auxiliary of Astana, Kazakstan, invited the world’s bishops to sign the document and join in raising a common voice in defense of the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage.
",-1
"Raising a Common Voice
",-1
"In conversation with LifeSiteNews, Schneider said greater public support of the document from the world’s 5,000 bishops would be “a stronger voice for professing the constant truths of the Church, and it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.”
",-1
"The Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage was issued by three Kazakh Ordinaries, including Bishop Schneider, in early January.
",-1
"In the document, the three bishops solemnly professed the Church’s received teaching and discipline regarding sacramental marriage and the limited conditions (see Familiaris Consortio, n. 84) under which Catholics who are divorced and “remarried” may receive sacramental absolution and Holy Communion.
",-1
"They presented their profession “before God who will judge us,” in response to certain pastoral norms issued by several bishops’ conferences aimed at implementing chapter 8 of Pope Francis’ apostolic exhortation on the family, Amoris Laetitia.
",-1
"“This is contrary to Divine Revelation,” Schneider further told LifeSite, adding that the “beautiful explanations” that are being presented to clergy and faithful as “discernment” and “pastoral accompaniment,” or a “change of paradigm” and “discovery of the subjective part of the truth,” when translated into “common sense language,” are tantamount to an allowance to sin.
",-1
"“Our conscience as bishops calls to us to do this,” Schneider explained.
",-1
"“We were forced by our conscience, in the conscience of the Successors of the Apostles and colleagues of the Pope.”
",-1
"As Successors of the Apostles, Schneider said they “could not act in another way.”
",-1
"Bishop Marian Eleganti
",-1
"The profession’s most recent signatory, Bishop Marian Eleganti, O.S.B., is a monk of the abbey of the Missionary Benedictines in St. Otmarsberg in Uznach, located in the canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland.
",-1
"He was ordained to the priesthood on June 23, 1995.
",-1
"In July 1999, the monks of St. Otmarsberg Abbey (the youngest abbey in Switzerland) elected Eleganti the second abbot of the monastery.
",-1
"The Missionary Benedictines in Uznach belong to the Benedictine Congregation of St. Ottilien near Munich, with branches in Europe, East, West and South Africa, South America, Cuba and the USA, India, Korea, China, Kazakhstan and the Philippines.
",-1
"In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Abbot Marian Eleganti as auxiliary bishop of the diocese of Chur, Switzerland.
",-1
"He was ordained a bishop on Jan. 31, 2010.
",-1
"Since 2011, Bishop Eleganti has served as the Swiss Youth Bishop for German-speaking Switzerland on behalf of the Swiss Bishops’ Conference, and as vicar for religious and monastic communities.
",-1
"He is also the vicar for the philosophical-theological education and ongoing formation and training of pastoral workers.
",-1
"Bishop Marian Eleganti’s public support of the Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage brings the number of signatories to nine.
",-1
"To date, in addition to the three original signatories from Kazakstan, the following prelates have signed the profession: Cardinal Janis Pujats, Emeritus Archbishop Metropolitan of Riga, Latvia; Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, former apostolic nuncio to the United States; His Excellency Luigi Negri, Archbishop emeritus of Ferrara-Comacchio, Italy; Bishop Andreas Laun, Emeritus Auxiliary of Salzburg, Austria; and His Excellency Rene Gracida, Bishop emeritus of Corpus Christi, Texas, USA.

",-1
"""It makes me feel horrible,"" he said at a news conference Friday morning.
",-1
"""People need to do their research and think rather than just react viscerally.”
",-1
"Many of their theories lean heavily on Haig's LinkedIn profile, which says that Haig previously worked for Boeing and Northrop Grumman.
",-1
"They noted Haig's LinkedIn page, which says he worked for Boeing in Mesa as a senior liaison engineer in their unmanned helicopter division from 2010 to 2013.
",-1

",-1
"But Haig is an engineer, and he says he's not a former military officer.
",-1
"It should be noted that Haig's rounds were probably not even used in the massacre: Haig sold Paddock tracer ammunition, which emit a flare when fired making them easier to see.
",-1
"Had Paddock fired these rounds during the nighttime massacre at the concert, they would have been visible.
",-1
"Haig's attorney Marc Victor told reporters it was perfectly legal for Haig, a private citizen, to sell Paddock hundreds of rounds of tracer ammunition — the bullets are legal in Arizona.
",-1
"Paddock showed up to buy ammunition at Haig's home after meeting him at a gun show in Phoenix.
",-1
"""I sold him 600 rounds of .308 tracer, surplus U.S. military.

",-1
"""I put it in a box for him.
",-1
"He paid me, put it in his car, and left.""
",-1
"Haig said he's been legally selling ammunition as as a hobby since 1991, but after the massacre, he has stopped his side business.

"""I've seen all kinds of people.

"When asked about the threats, Haig said, “I’ve had people screaming they want me to die through my front door.""
",-1
"Haig and his attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the conspiracy theorizing.

"Haig said he's sorry that the massacre took place, but emphasized that he had nothing to do with Paddock's mass shooting.
",-1
"“I had no contribution to what Paddock did,” Haig said at the news conference.

"Nevertheless, it's hard to believe that Haig's denials will dissuade the conspiracy-mongers.

"Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future
",-1
"Pope Francis visits Genoa, Italy, in May 2017.
",-1
"(Reuters photo: Giorgio Perottino)
",-1
"In a debate, Ross Douthat and Massimo Faggioli discussed Pope Francis’s legacy and its effect on internal Church controversies.
",-1
"On Wednesday night, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat and Villanova professor of theology Massimo Faggioli came together for a debate entitled “Francis @ Five: Assessing the Legacy of Pope Francis Five Years after His Election.” As I made my way up to Fordham University, I was excited.
",-1
"Having followed Douthat and Faggioli’s ongoing dialogue on Twitter, I knew I was in for a lively, if predictable, conversation.
",-1
"In his opening remarks, Douthat laid out three criteria that can be used to evaluate Francis’s papacy thus far: his impact on the public’s perception of the Church (a success); his attempts at reforming the Vatican bureaucracy (a disappointment); and his position on “moral-theological controversies,” specifically, communion for the divorced and remarried (a problem).
",-1
"Advertisement
",-1
"Rather than making a straightforward case for why Pope Francis has changed the Church for the better, Faggioli rejected the possibility of evaluating his papacy in terms of “continuity” with past popes, since doing so would assume that “Christianity at some point .
",-1
"was complete,” which Faggioli does not think is true.
",-1
"While I emphatically disagree with this argument, I have to hand it to Faggioli: From the outset, he made clear that he was not planning to debate Douthat on the implications of the Francis papacy.
",-1
"To defend his position that remarried persons should be able to receive communion, Faggioli invoked the case of Germany, where 50 percent of Catholic marriages end in divorce.
",-1
"However, the fact remains that Faggioli is suggesting the Church do much more than provide sacraments to the faithful.
",-1
"Just before invoking the German case, Faggioli characterized the country as one of the most secular in the world.
",-1
"But rather than lamenting what secularism has wrought on marital life in Germany, reasserting the Church’s position on marriage, and insisting that the faithful strive to live according to her laws, Faggioli argues that the Church ought to bend to the will of secular society.
",-1
"It should be clear to anyone, not just practicing Catholics, that this is absurd.
",-1
"If the Church exists simply to accommodate the whims and failures of secular modernity, then what is the point of the Church?
",-1
"Pope Benedict XVI has warned against precisely the kind of “accommodation” Faggioli is calling for, writing that when “the people cannot cope” with God, they “bring him down into their own world,” and insist that “he must be the kind of God that [they need].” In other words, “Man is using God, and, in reality, even if it is not outwardly discernible, he is placing himself above God.” To fully drive the point home, Benedict equates this kind of worship with the Israelites desert worship of the bull calf.
",-1
"Throughout the debate, Faggioli drew out the argument that allowing the remarried to receive communion would not represent a radical change in doctrine but a return to the teachings of the Gospel.
",-1
"After a few seconds’ pause, Faggioli gave the only answer he could: “There are different responses to the same question in different times.”
",-1
"Throughout their conversation, both Douthat and Faggioli repeatedly observed that the debate over Pope Francis and the future of the Church is carried on primarily among Catholic intellectuals, unbeknownst to most of “the flock.”
",-1
"At its core, this debate is about truth and our ability to judge right from wrong.
",-1
"Of course not — that would be preposterous, as I’m sure Faggioli would agree.
",-1
"To pass moral judgements on papacies, presidencies, or anything else, we must have recourse to truth, and to the institutions that have upheld this truth for centuries.
",-1
"Whether in the Church or in the academy, we must resist this dangerous historicist impulse.

"The Democratic Party promotes itself as an advocacy group for all matters concerning homosexuals and labels politicians, who take stances opposite theirs on politically charged issues such as same-sex marriage, as bigots.
",-1
"Yet, the party keeps on inviting an imam, who has a long record of hostility toward homosexuals, to participate at its annual functions.
",-1
"On Saturday, October 7, 2017, the Palm Beach Democratic Party held its 2017 Truman Kennedy Johnson (TKJ) Dinner at the West Palm Beach Marriott Hotel, in West Palm Beach, Florida.
",-1
"The Keynote Speaker at the event was Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe.
",-1
"Other speakers included: United States Representative Alcee Hastings; then-Florida Democratic Party Chairman Stephen Bittel, who resigned in November over allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior; and then-Palm Beach County Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo, who was elected in December to take over for Bittel as Chair of the Florida Democratic Party.
",-1
"Prior to the speakers, there was a joint invocation performed by a rabbi, two pastors and an imam.
",-1
"The imam, Maulana Shafayat Mohamed, is notorious for his unapologetic vilification of homosexuals.
",-1
"Shafayat Mohamed is the imam of the Darul Uloom Institute, located in Pembroke Pines, Florida.
",-1
"The mosque has been a haven for terror-related individuals and activity.
",-1
"Now-deceased al-Qaeda Global Operations Chief, Adnan el-Shukrijumah, was a prayer leader at Darul Uloom.
",-1
"And Darul Uloom Arabic teacher Imran Mandhai, along with mosque goers Hakki Aksoy and Shueyb Mossa Jokhan, hatched a plot at the mosque to blow up different South Florida structures, including area power stations, Jewish businesses, and a National Guard armory.
",-1
"While terrorism plays a huge role in his mosque’s history – and he has been around for all of it – Shafayat Mohamed’s personal history deals much more in bigotry than terror.
",-1
"One stop on Shafayat Mohamed’s Facebook page and one can view his profile photo of him holding a dark green book with gold border and letters on the cover.
",-1
"The book is “The Meaning of THE HOLY QUR’AN,” a version of the Quran that was banned by the Los Angeles public school system, in February 2002, for containing numerous anti-Semitic commentaries.
",-1
"This may seem an innocent mistake on the imam’s part, but his actions against the gay community and sinister views are anything but.
",-1
"It is writings such as these that have gotten Shafayat Mohamed thrown off a number of Broward County boards.
",-1
"Even so, the imam has been unrepentant.
",-1
"In a speech he gave at Darul Uloom, in August 2015, titled ‘Quraan Torah Bible Forbid Man Marrying Man,’ he admitted that he “got sacked from many [county] boards, because there were a lot of gay people who said, ‘We don’t want him on that board.’” He said he had a choice, to “sit in Paradise or… sit on the board and go to Hell.”
",-1
"He began his speech by attacking President Barack Obama for supporting same-sex marriage.
",-1
"He asked the following, “Did you hear what President Obama said?… Do you know what a sad situation we are in this country?...
",-1
"Here you have the President of the United States of America saying that a man could marry a man?… Are we sleeping?
",-1
"Do you believe in the Quran?
",-1
"Shafayat Mohamed later lamented the existence of Muslim homosexuals.
",-1
"He decried, “Listen.
",-1
"Don’t deny it.
",-1
"They already got Muslim gay communities.” He as well spoke of his support for polygamy, an act that is illegal in the United States.
",-1
"He exclaimed, “Here the President says a man can marry a man, but you can’t say a man can have four wives…!”
",-1
"The October TKJ Dinner was not the first Democrat event Shafayat Mohamed has participated in.
",-1
"In fact, he has been involved in many, including giving the invocations at the Florida Democratic Party’s annual Leadership Blue Gala in 2014 (featuring Bill Clinton), 2015 and 2016.
",-1
"And given that this author has written about this before, the October event will probably not be the last occasion that he is embraced by the Democratic Party.

"Farrakhan’s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks, saying white people “deserve to die” and praising Adolf Hitler as a “very great man.” “I personally know [Farrakhan], I’ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,” Davis told TheDC.
",-1
"When asked about Farrakhan’s history of anti-Semitic comments, Davis was dismissive and said that many people in politics have a history of inflammatory comments.
",-1
"Like this.
",-1
"Farrakhan had praised Hitler and declared that the Jews, ""can't say 'Never Again' to God, because when he puts you in the ovens, you're there forever.”
",-1
"""Here come the Jews.
",-1
"They don't like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler.
",-1
"Well, that's a good name.
",-1
"Hitler was a very great man.""
",-1
"Would a Republican get a pass on meeting with a racist hate group leader?
",-1
"Obviously not.
",-1
"Obama's meeting with Farrakhan was part of a CBC event.
",-1
"The Caucus has yet to apologize for it.
",-1
"Don't expect it to condemn Rep. Davis' comments.
",-1
"He was just saying what most of them think.
",-1
"It just won't address left-wing anti-Semitism and racism.

"FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976
",-1
"It was held at the Radisson South Hotel, Minneapolis, on Tuesday, May 12, 1976, and its stated purpose was to assist the Archbishop in gaining a stronger foothold for the Society of St. Pius X in the States during the unprecedented crisis Blessed Pope Paul had helped unleash on the Church.
",-1
"And for those of us who’ve been in the trenches for a long, long time it also provides welcome reminder of why we must continue to fight.
",-1
"Even though I personally was in attendance back in 1976 when Archbishop Lefebvre delivered this address in Minneapolis, I was only ten years old and of course didn't realize how prophetic he was on that occasion, or how devastated by the Second Vatican Council, the New Mass, and the Freemasonic infiltration of the Vatican.
",-1
"In fact, this transcript reads like a message of encouragement at a crucial moment in the history of this movement—Stay in the fight!
",-1
"Keep the Faith.
",-1
"Never surrender!
",-1
"And now that Pope Francis has inadvertently unmasked the true spirit of Vatican II, it becomes obvious how and why those who resisted that spirit were right to have done so and will certainly be hailed by history as the heroic band of Catholic brothers that mounted the twentieth century’s last stand for Christ the King and, while scorned and mocked at the time, were nevertheless totally vindicated fifty years later.
",-1
"May we continue to earn the right to stand with them today.

"The Archbishop Speaks
",-1
"Ladies and Gentlemen:
",-1
"As I said to Mr. [Walter] Matt, I can say in bad English what he says in good English, because he said all of the things I want to say [Referring here to Walter Matt’s introductory talk referenced above.]
",-1
"And I thank you, Mr. Matt, very much, for his invitation, and I thank you for your coming, and I thank Fr.
",-1
"Ward for what he said about the Society of St. Pius X.
",-1
"And I hope that you can understand my poor English, but I think it is better to speak some bad English because to translate would take too much time.
",-1
"As Mr. Matt said, the crisis in the Church is very extraordinary.
",-1
"It is very difficult to understand the situation today.
",-1
"My seminary in Econe (in Switzerland) and the seminaries in Germany and here in America, in Armada, are in very difficult situations with Rome.
",-1
"Why?
",-1
"These seminaries are the same as seminaries were before the Second Vatican Council.
",-1
"They have the same discipline and the same studies, they make good priests; I think they are good seminarians.
",-1
"All is done as all the seminaries before the Second Vatican Council.
",-1
"Why are we now in this very sad situation with Rome?
",-1
"But we do not change.
",-1
"We continue the Tradition.
",-1
"So why do they now say, as Mgr.
",-1
"(Archbishop) Benelli[1] said to me months ago on the 19th of March, “you are out of communion with the Church.” I am out of communion with the Church because I continue the Tradition of the Church?
",-1
"This is possible?
",-1
"I do not understand.
",-1
"I have done nothing.
",-1
"I believe nothing other than what the Church has believed for twenty centuries.
",-1
"Mgr.
",-1
"Benelli then said to me, you must put down in a writing to the Holy Father that you accept the Second Vatican Council, you accept the reform that followed the Council, and that you accept the orientations that have been given by Rome.
",-1
"Benelli took the book of the New Ordo, gave it to me, and said, “You must say this New Mass in all of your houses.”
",-1
"I wonder why Mgr.
",-1
"Benelli did not communicate this condition to me before our meeting.
",-1
"[2] He could have done so.
",-1
"For example, one year ago three cardinals sent me a letter (Cardinals Wright, Tabera [Arturo Carinal Tabera Araoz, one of the Council Fathers MJM], and Gabriel-Marie Garrone) telling me (in effect) that I must close the seminaries.
",-1
"I am sure that my seminaries are contributing to the restoration of the Church.
",-1
"I do not destroy the Church.
",-1
"And so I said to Mgr.
",-1
"Benelli, “No, I will not sign that writing.”
",-1
"And do you think this change in the Church came suddenly?
",-1
"When, then?
",-1
"At the beginning of the Council?
",-1
"No, this change in the Church began one century before [the Council].
",-1
"In [1844], Pope Pius IX ordered Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.
",-1
"[3] The Pope himself asked Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.
",-1
"And what did these Instructions say?
",-1
"The Instructions said that they [the Carbonari/Freemasons] must begin to fight against the Church by bringing reform into the Church.
",-1
"The Instructions said the infiltration will take perhaps not one year, perhaps not ten years, but perhaps a century.
",-1
"The Carbonari must enter into the seminary, into the convent, into the sacristy, and slowly, very slowly, the priests will have the ideals of the revolution; of the Freemasons.
",-1
"One day these priests, imbued with Masonic principles, will become bishops, and these bishops can then choose a pope.
",-1
"And even if the pope is not a Freemason, he will have the same ideals as the Freemasons.
",-1
"Pope Pius IX called for the publishing of these Instructions in order to warn the bishops and priests of those times of the fight against the church.
",-1
"In 1895, the Catholic Antonia Fogazzaro, a known modernist, founded a masonic lodge in Milan.
",-1
"He wrote in his book, Il Santo, that “We [modernists]…want a reform in the Church…without rebellion, carried out by legitimate authority…even if this takes 20, 30, or 50 years.”[4] “The reform will have to be brought about in the name of obedience.” The modernist ideas in the Church introduced and enacted through obedience!
",-1
"And I think…well, here we are!
",-1
"In this time!
",-1
"The reform is here, and it is brought about through obedience, to the Council, to the bishop, to the priest.
",-1
"And all they say is “Obedience, obedience, obedience.”
",-1
"The Instructions of the Carbonari say the bishop and the priest will think that they are following the tiara of the Pope, but they will be following the flag of Freemasonry [“the banner of revolution”].
",-1
"They said that.
",-1
"They wrote that!
",-1
"One century before [the Council]!
",-1
"Thus, it is very important to know that they prepared for the beginning of the Second Vatican Council for a century, perhaps two centuries!
",-1
"As the Archbishop of Dakar and President of the Episcopal Commission for French-speaking West Africa, I was appointed member of the Central Preparatory Commission of the Second Vatican Council.
",-1
"There were some seventy cardinals, twenty bishops, and four super-authorities of the religious orders, among others.
",-1
"Before the last meeting of this Commission the members received two schemas on the same subject: one from Cardinal Ottaviani and another from Cardinal Bea.
",-1
"The schema from Cardinal Ottaviani was titled “…On Religious Tolerance” and the other, from Cardinal Bea, was titled “On Religious Freedom [Liberty].” When we read these two schemas, we thought, “This is impossible.
",-1
"How is it we can receive two opposing theses?
",-1
"One says we must not tolerate error.
",-1
"The other says that error has the right to exist in the name of the dignity of the human person.” And so, we go into the meeting.
",-1
"Cardinal Ruffini had to intervene as we were in front of two cardinals, our brothers.
",-1
"He said we must wait for the authority to say who is right and who is wrong.
",-1
"But before the Pope came (because the Pope came many times to present at these meetings) we voted on the schema.
",-1
"Who is with Cardinal Ottaviani?
",-1
"Who is with Cardinal Bea?
",-1
"The conservatives and the liberals.
",-1
"As the last meeting of the Preparatory Commission, it was for me the first image of the future Council.
",-1
"This historic address appeared for the first time ever in a print edition of The Remnant last year.
",-1
"Isn't it time for you to subscribe?
",-1
"And as we go into the Council, you know that on the first day of the Council, Cardinal Lienart was the chief of the liberal cardinals in the Council, [together] with all of the Cardinals of the Rhine (such as Cardinal Alfrink, Cardinal Frings, Cardinal Dopfner, Cardinal Suenens, Cardinal Leinart, and Cardinal Koenig of Austria).
",-1
"This Cardinal was the chief of the liberals in the Council.
",-1
"That is my cardinal; he ordained me to the priesthood, and he consecrated me a bishop.
",-1
"And now this is public.
",-1
"Nobody has been able to refute the publication.
",-1
"Now, some say the Council is (was) good, but only the reforms were bad.
",-1
"That is not true.
",-1
"Because when the reforms come, Rome always says the reforms are being done in the name of the Council.
",-1
"It is evident that all of the reforms came from the Council.
",-1
"Rome said in the name of the Declaration of Liturgy, we [implement] the liturgical reform.
",-1
"We can say that [these bad changes are] not in the text of the Declaration, but this man has the authority to say that this is from the Council.
",-1
"They know that.
",-1
"And I am sure that it [the mutation] is in the Council.
",-1
"Even if it is not explicitly [stated] in the Council but [rather] in the spirit of the Council, it is the same!
",-1
"For example, with religious freedom: now the Holy See and all the Nuncios are against the Catholic State in the name of the Council - in the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom.
",-1
"I have heard this (personally) twice.
",-1
"The first time I was in Columbia.
",-1
"When I was in Columbia, I read in the paper about the change in the first article of the Constitution of the Republic of Columbia.
",-1
"[The first article] stated that only the Republic of Columbia recognizes only the Catholic religion.
",-1
"They changed it.
",-1
"They removed this article.
",-1
"I read the discourse of the President of Columbia with the Nuncios of Columbia and the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference in Columbia.
",-1
"He said to the people, “even though we remove this article we remain Catholic.
",-1
"Then, the discourse of the Nuncio was the discourse of a Freemason: all of it was “progress,” “humanity,” “evolution,” and all the hubris of a Freemason.
",-1
"But I will never…I do not accept the concept, because you destroy the Catholic State in the name of the Council.
",-1
"Are you sure?
",-1
"Yes, sure.
",-1
"It is evident.
",-1
"Now I said to the [Secretary], “As I speak with you now about Columbia, I know that you are the one responsible for the change in the constitution of Valais in Switzerland one year ago.
",-1
"The change in the Constitution of Valais was the same.” (Because you know Switzerland is a Federation where some states are Protestant and some states are Catholic.
",-1
"The Valais is Catholic.
",-1
"And in its constitution, the words of the first article [of the constitution] of the State of Valais – Econe, where we are located, is in the State of Valais - only one religion is recognized: The Catholic Church.)
",-1
"And [the Secretary] said, “Yes, I am responsible for this change.” Brother, what did you do with the Social Kingship of Christ?
",-1
"What is this for you?
",-1
"What do you say when you say “thy kingdom come” in your prayer, the Our Father?
",-1
"“Ah,” the Nuncio said to me, “Now it is impossible.” What did you do with the encyclical of Pope Pius XI, Quas Primas?
",-1
"“Ah, but now the Pope cannot write an encyclical like Quas Primas.”
",-1
"It is incredible.
",-1
"And all in the name of the Council.
",-1
"We must take care, because this change in the church is a liberal change.
",-1
"The liberal principles have entered the Church now, and they destroy the Church.
",-1
"If we cannot set out the true principles of the Church, if we in the name of religious freedom said that all religions have the same right in every state in the world…
",-1
"[missing audio...]
",-1
"The truth is the only one King of the World is Jesus Christ.
",-1
"We say in the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, “Tu solus Altissimus,” “Tu solus Dominus,” “You alone are the Highest,” “You alone are the Lord.” But practically, we would refuse this Kingdom of Jesus Christ if we said that Luther, Mohammed, Buddha and Jesus Christ are all the same.
",-1
"We cannot say that.
",-1
"We know that in many states (it is a pity) it is impossible [to recognize Catholicism as the state religion].
",-1
"We must tolerate - have tolerance for the error - but never give the same right to error and truth.
",-1
"That is impossible.
",-1
"And the change in the liturgy is very important.
",-1
"It is very bad.
",-1
"One of the principles of modern man, as they say now, “modern man,” is democracy.
",-1
"And democracy can have a good sense but not if [by that term is meant] that those who govern receive their authority from the people.
",-1
"The authority comes from God.
",-1
"Not from the people.
",-1
"Not from the masses.
",-1
"From God.
",-1
"It is impossible.
",-1
"And our liturgy is the school of our Faith.
",-1
"It is the first school of our Faith for all people.
",-1
"I was in Africa as a missionary and as bishop for 30 years.
",-1
"I know the liturgy was the best school of the Faith for people who cannot read.
",-1
"They can see what the priest does.
",-1
"They can see what the priest does at the adoration of the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ.
",-1
"And they know that Jesus Christ is present - His real presence is on the altar - by the attitude of the priest.
",-1
"That is very important.
",-1
"Because we know the liturgy teaches us hierarchy.
",-1
"The true liturgy is hierarchical.
",-1
"Because we have God, the priest, and then the people.
",-1
"That is hierarchy.
",-1
"When we are in Church we know God is on the altar; the priest is between God and the people; and the people receive God at the hand of the priest.
",-1
"But now the new liturgy is more democratic - all around the table.
",-1
"The priest is only the president, and sometimes another man can take the role of the president of the meal.
",-1
"That is a new liturgy.
",-1
"That is very bad, because we have no sense of the hierarchical; whereas the sense of hierarchy is very important in our life.
",-1
"We need the authority of God.
",-1
"We need the Real Presence of God on our altar.
",-1
"We need the Sacrifice of the Mass – not a meal only – but the Sacrifice.
",-1
"So, the Victim of the Sacrifice is really present on our altar.
",-1
"That is the school of our Faith.
",-1
"And slowly, slowly, this new Mass equivocates.
",-1
"It moves the minds of the faithful in a Protestant [direction].
",-1
"I do not say that all [Novus Ordo] Masses are invalid.
",-1
"But perhaps, more and more, they become invalid because [the ministers lose faith in the Real Presence].
",-1
"Recently, in France, a progressive paper conducted a statistical survey to see how many priests no longer have faith in the Real Presence.
",-1
"But I think that if they directed this question to all of the priests who are under 50 years of age, they would find that fifty percent [have lost the faith in the Real Presence], because the young priests have no faith.
",-1
"Last year, Bishop Adam (in our Diocese of Sion, Switzerland) ordained one priest for my Congregation of the Holy Ghost Fathers.
",-1
"This one priest came from France.
",-1
"His uncle had died in a road accident when his cab fell in the river.
",-1
"The uncle had nine children.
",-1
"The Bishop said to the new priest, “Now you can say Mass for your uncle.
",-1
"Now you are a priest, and you can say Mass for your uncle.” The new priest said, “No, never.” Why?
",-1
"It is not useful to say Mass for the dead?
",-1
"“No, no, it is impossible.
",-1
"They are already in heaven.” This young priest who was ordained by the Bishop last year for my Congregation is now a professor in the minor seminary in Switzerland.
",-1
"They are not learning theology, not philosophy, not anything.
",-1
"Another example.
",-1
"Recently, I had two young [potential] seminarians come to my house near Paris.
",-1
"One of them works in a factory, and the other is a university student.
",-1
"They told me they were [considering] the seminary of Paris.
",-1
"I asked them, “Why do you come to see me?” They told me that they had a meeting in the house of the Oblate of Maria with the priest who oversees young men who may have vocations to the priesthood in the Diocese of Paris.
",-1
"There was a total of fifteen young men for all of the Diocese of Paris.
",-1
"We cannot remain in this seminary.” So, they came to meet me.
",-1
"They said that Econe is the only seminary where they seem to be able to find the True Faith.
",-1
"They asked for admittance to Econe.
",-1
"And I think that they shall be coming to Econe next October.
",-1
"But that is a new religion.
",-1
"It is a Protestant religion.
",-1
"That is a fact.
",-1
"Perhaps you can say, “How is it possible that the pope gives the authorization to this change?
",-1
"How is it possible the pope signed this decree?
",-1
"Signed this constitution?” I don’t know.
",-1
"It is a big mystery.
",-1
"There are many proposed theological answers.
",-1
"I cannot subscribe to all of them.
",-1
"Some say the pope is not responsible.
",-1
"Perhaps someone gave the pope an injection, a drug, and he is not responsible.
",-1
"Perhaps, I don’t know.
",-1
"Some say there are two popes [(a body double)].
",-1
"Some say the pope was liberal before he was elected pope, and perhaps (we do not know) he gave his name to Freemasonry (thereby incurring excommunication before the conclave).
",-1
"We do not know.
",-1
"And because he had an indiscretion with his Masonic appurtenances, the Pope sent him as a Nuncio in Iran.
",-1
"I don’t know.
",-1
"We don’t know.
",-1
"Now, you cannot say that Archbishop Lefebvre said the pope gave his name to Freemasonry.
",-1
"No, you cannot say that.
",-1
"But if he was excommunicated, then he is not pope.
",-1
"Illegitimate.
",-1
"It is a mystery I cannot understand.
",-1
"But the fact is that the Catholic Church is being destroyed, and now even the pope himself says that.
",-1
"This pope has referred to the auto-demolition of the Church.
",-1
"Well, there they are.
",-1
"They are the men who destroy the Church.
",-1
"We must show where they are.
",-1
"I do not know, but it is the pope himself who said that.
",-1
"And I have these experiences every day.
",-1
"I visit many countries.
",-1
"I was in Spain during the Christmas Holy Days.
",-1
"Then I was in Bonn, near Cologne, Germany, three weeks ago, to speak at a conference.
",-1
"Many people came.
",-1
"Many people are confused.
",-1
"What is happening in the Church?
",-1
"They are anxious.
",-1
"But many people say that we disobey.
",-1
"Disobey?
",-1
"Obedience is relative.
",-1
"It is not absolute.
",-1
"It is relative to the good, but not to the evil.
",-1
"We cannot obey our parents if they command a bad thing.
",-1
"We cannot obey.
",-1
"It is clear.
",-1
"And I know that in Spain, for example, the situation in the Church is very bad.
",-1
"The new nominees of bishops and many auxiliary bishops are, approximately, communist, Marxist, and socialist.
",-1
"And so, a majority of the bishops in the Episcopal Conference of Spain are progressives.
",-1
"They are modernists.
",-1
"Whereas, the majority of the bishops [from Spain] during the Council were conservative.
",-1
"So, Rome is responsible [for the situation of the Church in Spain] because it is Rome who approves the nominations for bishops.
",-1
"And we know in France, in Germany, and in Europe generally, that all of the young bishops are worse [than the bishops in Spain] in that they are more or less Marxist.
",-1
"How can they do that?
",-1
"I do not know.
",-1
"I have not spent my whole life in Rome.
",-1
"I do know Rome very well, because I was an apostolic delegate, and I was in the Secretariate of the Secretary of State.
",-1
"And I know that very well.
",-1
"We must pray.
",-1
"We must ask God to put an end to this crisis of the Church.
",-1
"They lose the faith.
",-1
"They cannot go into the church.
",-1
"They abandon the faith.
",-1
"You know that many priests have abandoned the faith.
",-1
"Many priests have gotten married.
",-1
"And many sisters have abandoned their congregations.
",-1
"It is a pity.
",-1
"And it is everywhere.
",-1
"I was in Melbourne, Australia, during the 40th International Eucharistic Congress.
",-1
"Cardinal Knox, who was the man responsible for the Eucharistic Congress, is now the Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship.
",-1
"You cannot go to that Mass.
",-1
"This is a fact.
",-1
"They also called me by phone in Melbourne to say I was on the list of the bishops [attending] the Eucharistic Congress.
",-1
"They asked me to concelebrate Mass with a Protestant pastor and a rabbi.
",-1
"Ay.
",-1
"Impossible.
",-1
"No, no, no, no.
",-1
"[applause]
",-1
"This change is not accidental.
",-1
"It is not superficial.
",-1
"It is very deep.
",-1
"Very bad.
",-1
"It is against our faith.
",-1
"And so, we cannot accept this Council and this reform and this orientation even though it comes from Rome.
",-1
"From Rome we expect only the good.
",-1
"We do not expect the bad, the ill. We do not expect the abandonment of adoration in the Mass.
",-1
"We need this adoration.
",-1
"We need to have the faith in the divinity of Jesus Christ.
",-1
"Because all [of this change] is [oriented] against the divinity of Jesus Christ, against the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, against the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Mass.
",-1
"It is a sin when we abandon the truth of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, everywhere, and we abandon the Faith of the divinity of Jesus Christ.
",-1
"He is King because he is God.
",-1
"He is the Son of God.
",-1
"So, He is King by His nature.
",-1
"This is essential.
",-1
"And so, we cannot accept the diminution of this Truth.
",-1
"Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
",-1
"Jesus Christ is God.
",-1
"That is a fundamental truth of our Faith.
",-1
"And it all depends on this Truth.
",-1
"And we know now that the theologians and the bishops have [a new orientation].
",-1
"They do not express this truth clearly and perfectly.
",-1
"They are afraid of the truth.
",-1
"That is very bad.
",-1
"And it is the same in Rome.
",-1
"I think they refuse [to grant me an audience with] the pope, [because they are afraid of the Truth].
",-1
"When I was in Rome one month ago, Mgr.
",-1
"Benelli told me he visits the pope every day.
",-1
"He said that when he left me, he would go immediately to the pope to express the importance of the work we had conducted during our meeting.
",-1
"Immediately, he said, he would be going.
",-1
"So, why do they not grant me the possibility of visiting the pope?
",-1
"Because they are afraid.
",-1
"Meanwhile the Vatican operated a veritable swinging door where actual heretics and schismatics were concerned.
",-1
"Here, again, is Blessed Paul VI, famously meeting for the first time ever with the heretic Archbishop of Canterbury in St. Peter's:
",-1
"Cardinal Villot said, “We are afraid if Msgr.
",-1
"He is a mysterious man.
",-1
"We cannot give a definition of the man.
",-1
"He expresses the truth, and then he does the contrary/opposite.
",-1
"Some part of him will speak the truth.
",-1
"Another part of him is open to error.
",-1
"Very curious.
",-1
"And they are afraid that if I reveal the truth [and tell the Pope] “you must affirm the Kingdom of Jesus Christ everywhere and always each day.
",-1
"You must affirm the Real Presence in the Mass - in the Sacrifice of the Mass,” then perhaps it is possible that the Pope will change his mind.
",-1
"And so, Cardinal Villot says, there is a confusion, and they do not want me to visit the pope.
",-1
"It is impossible to admit me.
",-1
"And I know the pope very well!
",-1
"When I was the apostolic delegate to Pius XII, I was going to Rome every year.
",-1
"And during those eleven years, I met Msgr.
",-1
"Montini.
",-1
"He received me twice during the Council, for a private audience with the pope.
",-1
"But, now, with my position against the Council and the reforms, he says: “No, impossible!
",-1
"You must sign in writing that you [accept] the Council and all the reforms before I will receive you in audience.” But I cannot do that.
",-1
"For me, if I do that, then I betray my mother, the Church.
",-1
"The Church!
",-1
"So, I thank you very much for your encouragement, and I must say that we have a very good generation of young men and good vocations.
",-1
"For the coming year we have 59 applications to our seminary in Econe, Switzerland – applications from the United States, from England, from Germany, from France, and Spain.
",-1
"Good young men with good dispositions are coming from everywhere.
",-1
"And why?
",-1
"Why do they come to this seminary when they know we are in difficulties with Rome?
",-1
"But still they come.
",-1
"I ask them, why do you come to Econe?
",-1
"You know our situation.
",-1
"They say, “Yes, we know your situation, but we want to become true priests and not protestant pastors or modernist priests.
",-1
"We are coming to your seminary because we know that the end of the priest is to offer the true Sacrifice of the Mass.
",-1
"And so, we are Coming to Econe.”
",-1
"And as I have visited my seminary here in Armada for the past five days, I can see it is the same here.
",-1
"We have very good young men.
",-1
"I also have some Americans in my seminary in Econe.
",-1
"In six weeks I will ordain one American priest from Detroit, who is a very good seminarian and will be a good priest.
",-1
"But these young men refuse to become protestants.
",-1
"They refuse to become modernist.
",-1
"They ask to become true priests.
",-1
"And it is a pity there are not 100 bishops opening good seminaries.
",-1
"So, I ask you to pray for these seminarians because when they become priests they will have many worries and many difficulties.
",-1
"I think, however, they are very well prepared to deal with these difficulties and worries.
",-1
"And we have confidence in God.
",-1
"Since I began this work six years ago, now, I have evidence that God is assisting us.
",-1
"Because it is impossible, I realize, to do this by myself.
",-1
"We now have houses in Switzerland (3), Munich, France (6), Brussels (1), England, Armada, San Francisco, and New York.
",-1
"In Albano, near Rome, we have a congregation of sisters where I have five vocations from the states (good sisters).
",-1
"And I am building a seminary in Switzerland.
",-1
"It is impossible to do all this without God’s assistance.
",-1
"So, I have confidence.
",-1
"It is impossible for the Church to change its tradition.
",-1
"The tradition of twenty centuries.
",-1
"The Church is tradition.
",-1
"It is not revolution.

"Vote targeting Jewish student politician was not anti-Semitic: McGill report
",-1
"MONTREAL – It was political disagreement — not anti-Semitism — that led to a Jewish student being voted off the McGill University student council’s board of directors, an investigation ordered by the principal has concluded.
",-1
"A joint statement from five campus Jewish groups says the report, released this week by principal Suzanne Fortier, “appears to condone discrimination against Jewish students at McGill based on the cultural and religious organizations they affiliate with.”
",-1
"The controversy has its roots in McGill’s long-running debate over the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.
",-1
"At an Oct. 23 general assembly of the Student Society of McGill University, a routine motion to elect a slate of directors turned contentious.
",-1
"Supporters of a group called Democratize SSMU, formed to fight a decision of the board of directors declaring BDS counter to the SSMU constitution, brought a motion to divide the election vote.
",-1
"In the past they had been ratified as a bloc.
",-1
"She also created a Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life and a support line to report incidents of intolerance.
",-1
"Boudreau interviewed 38 students over his three-and-a-half week investigation.
",-1
"His findings, he wrote, do “not substantiate the notion that the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism,” which he defined as hostility toward or discrimination against Jews.
",-1
"Rather, he found, votes against Lew were “motivated by politics, that is, based on his support for Israel and Zionism and/or for his view of the BDS movement.” Protests about Israel’s policies cannot be equated with anti-Semitism, Boudreau wrote, though he said Lew’s belief that he was targeted because he was Jewish was “honest and even understandable.”
",-1
"A statement Wednesday by Hillel McGill, Chabad at McGill and three other Jewish groups said Boudreau was mistaken about the timing of an anti-Semitic message posted online by Democratize SSMU.
",-1
"Boudreau’s report said the message followed the assembly vote, but in fact it was posted at the beginning of October.
",-1
"The Jewish groups said this anti-Semitic rhetoric “was used to encourage students to vote specifically against Noah Lew.
",-1
"It is under this context that the (general assembly) occurred, and the report fundamentally misunderstands this, which alters the entire findings of the report.”
",-1
"They say Boudreau’s report “insinuates that Jewish students who engage with mainstream Jewish community organizations are permitted to be precluded from holding political office.”
",-1
"Lew was restored to his post as a director last month after a ruling that the split vote in October had violated the SSMU constitution.
",-1
"He was not immediately available for comment.
",-1
"“The report does not present a full or accurate picture of the hostile atmosphere facing Jewish students at McGill,” he said in a statement.
",-1
"Fortier said the university’s next actions will be based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life, due to report in April.

"Virginia man who wanted to join ISIS pleads guilty to lying about overseas trip
",-1
"NORFOLK, Va. — While texting with an FBI informant in September 2016, a Williamsburg man expressed admiration for a U.S. Army officer who shot and killed 13 soldiers on Fort Hood, Texas, according to court documents.
",-1
"Later that year, Shivam Patel, 28, tried to join the U.S. Army and Air Force.
",-1
"Patel pleaded guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court to two counts of making false statements.
",-1
"He faces up to 15 years in prison when sentenced June 4.
",-1
"According to court documents and prosecutors, Patel – who was raised Hindu before converting to Islam several years ago – traveled to China in July 2016 to teach English.
",-1
"While there, however, he grew displeased with how that country treated Muslims.
",-1
"His employer arranged for Patel to fly back to Virginia on Aug. 23, 2016, but instead Patel chose to travel to Jordan, a statement of facts filed with his plea agreement said.
",-1
"Jordanian officials arrested Patel a few days later.
",-1
"It's unclear why, but court documents say Patel told taxi drivers and others in Jordan that he supported the Islamic State.
",-1
"A search of Patel's computer also showed he researched how to join the Islamic State before he left for China.
",-1
"Jordanian officials moved for Patel's deportation.
",-1
"On Sept. 2, 2016, he boarded a flight to Chicago, and the next day, he flew to Detroit.
",-1
"There, he met an FBI source and started talking about the Islamic State.
",-1
"But, he said, he was afraid of making his parents sad.
",-1
"He also sang an Islamic State fight song and recalled making a replica of the group’s flag.
",-1
"He said he wanted to replace his neighbor’s American flag with it.
",-1
"Patel returned to Williamsburg on Sept. 6, 2016.
",-1
"Shortly thereafter, he moved into a motel his parents owned and started applying for jobs with the military, as well as some paramilitary organizations – like police and fire departments, correctional facilities and probation offices.
",-1
"While back in Virginia, Patel stayed in touch with the FBI source.
",-1
"He texted the source on Sept. 23, 2016, and expressed support for Maj. Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 soldiers in 2009 while serving at Fort Hood.
",-1
"In the process, however, he misidentified Hasan as Nidal Hussein and said the shooting happened at Fort Knox in Kentucky.
",-1
"He also said Hasan had died a martyr, though in fact he remains alive on military death row.
",-1
"Court documents show Patel began saying in late 2016 that he did not actually support the Islamic State.
",-1
"Simply expressing support for a terrorist organization or attack is not against the law.
",-1
"Patel's crime was failing to disclose his trips to Jordan when he was trying to join the Army and Air Force in December 2016 and January 2017.
",-1
"Court documents say Patel lied about his travel history, saying his only time out of the country in the past seven years was a family trip to India in 2011 and 2012.
",-1
"Before Patel signed the Army application, a recruiter asked him specifically about the travel question and reminded him providing false information could result in criminal charges.
",-1
"During the interview, the recruiter asked to see Patel's passport to confirm his travel claims.
",-1
"After Patel's arrest in July, investigators found his passport ""near"" the motel room where he was living, the documents said.

"Uranium One Informant Breaks Silence: Moscow Paid Millions To Influence Hillary Clinton
",-1
"The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.
",-1
"-Article 2, Section 4 of the US Constitution
",-1
"Right off the bat, this appears to be clear bribery, and a case could be made for treason.
",-1
"However, it is now being reported that an FBI informant that was involved in the Uranium One deal, has told congressional committees that Moscow paid lobbyists to influence then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by helping former President Bill Clinton’s charities during the Obama administration.
",-1
"The Hill's John Solomon reported on Wednesday:
",-1
"The informant, Douglas Campbell, said in the statement obtained by The Hill that he was told by Russian nuclear executives that Moscow had hired the American lobbying firm APCO Worldwide specifically because it was in position to influence the Obama administration, and more specifically Hillary Clinton.
",-1
"... Campbell added in the testimony that Russian nuclear officials “told me at various times that they expected APCO to apply a portion of the $3 million annual lobbying fee it was receiving from the Russians to provide in-kind support for the Clintons' Global Initiative.""
",-1
"“The contract called for four payments of $750,000 over twelve months.
",-1
"APCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from Uranium One to the U.S.-Russia Civilian Nuclear Cooperation agreement.""
",-1
"APCO officials told The Hill that its support for the Clinton Global Initiative and its work with Russia were not connected in any way, and in fact involved different divisions of the firm.
",-1
"They added their lobbying for Russia did not involve Uranium One but rather focused on regulatory issues aimed at helping Russia better compete for nuclear fuel contracts inside the United States.
",-1
"In case you are unfamiliar with Uranium One, it is a Canadian mining company whose sale to a Russian firm was approved in 2010.
",-1
"The sale gave the Russians control of part of the US uranium supply, thus why I reference a case could be made for treason.
",-1
"While Democrats have unsurprisingly questioned Campbell's credibility, Campbell's attorney Victoria Toensing told Sean Hannity, “[The Russians] were so confident that they told Mr. Campbell with the Clinton’s help, it was a shoo-in to get CFIUS [The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] approval.
",-1
"They were so confident in that that they even had him open up the new office because they were planning on the kind of business they were going to do as soon as CFIUS approved it.”
",-1
"In a lengthy report by Award-winning National Security/War Correspondent Sara Carter, she pointed out that following:
",-1
"On Wednesday, he shared with the committee information he provided to the FBI and has in the past described his frustration with the Obama administration’s failure to stop Russia’s nuclear giant from purchasing 20 percent of American uranium mining assets.
",-1
"Campbell testified before numerous Congressional investigators that his extensive counterintelligence work on Russia and stated that during his time as an informant, he obtained information that Russia was continuing to aid the Iranian government.
",-1
"According to Campbell Russia provided the resources necessary for the nation’s nuclear reactors, despite promises that they were not sharing such technology with Iran.
",-1
"In an April 16, 2010, summary brief provided to his former FBI handlers and obtained by this reporter, he stressed his deep concerns about Tenex, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian state nuclear arm Rosatom and its ongoing work to provide Iran with the technology needed for its nuclear reactor program.
",-1
"At the time, Rosatom was seeking the approval to purchase the Canadian mining company Uranium One.
",-1
"“TENEX continues to supply Iran with fuel through their Russian company TVEL,” stated Campbell in a 2010 brief provided to the FBI.
",-1
"TVEL is a Russian nuclear fuel cycle company headquartered in Moscow.
",-1
"“They (TVEL) continue to assist with construction consult and fabricated assemblies to supply the reactor.
",-1
"Fabricated assemblies require sophisticated engineering and are arranged inside the reactor with the help and consult of TVEL.” Campbell informed the FBI of the close relationship between TVEL and TENEX, both a part of the Rosatom group.
",-1
"He stated in his brief that while spending time with the Russian executives from both Rosatom and Tenex, that any mention of “TVEL is a subject that is serious to all when mentioned.
",-1
"I do not even raise the subject of TVEL to our friends, but occasionally they speak of it and always in a guarded manner.” In the briefs, he informed the FBI that “occasionally someone will mention having been in Iran but usually it is long after the fact.” And when he asked the Russians about these connections, he stated that they “occasionally speak of the relationship, i.e.
",-1
"equipment, consulting.
",-1
"I asked Vadim (Mikerin) if they felt there was a serious problem, and would they adhere to sanctions and western opinion.
",-1
"His response was a smile and shoulder shrug.” But Campbell had provided the FBI with evidence of the criminal network and delivered the information to the FBI, which was monitoring his work as an informant and approving his transfer of bribery money to the Russians.
",-1
"Those transfers, which were made in bulk $50,000 sums and at times delivered in cash, occurred between senior executives of the American transportation company and the Russian executives connected to Rosatom.
",-1
"He had given the FBI irrefutable evidence showing how contracts obtained from the same Russian energy company Tenex, were based on contract bribery and other nefarious actions, he said.
",-1
"Senior members of the FBI, Department of Treasury, Department of Energy and Department of Justice were also briefed on Campbell’s information and were apprised of the various facets pertaining to Russia’s acquisition of the Canadian company.
",-1
"In fact, Campbell had been told by his FBI handlers that his work had made it at least twice into President Obama’s classified presidential daily briefings.
",-1
"Of course, we know what Obama did with his daily briefings.
",-1
"They are somewhere in the White House sewer system.
",-1
"Campbell's work has resulted in real justice being administered.
",-1
"In January, I reported:
",-1
"On Friday, the Justice Department unsealed an 11-count indictment concerning the Uranium One scandal.
",-1
"Sadly, it did not include former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but rather former DoD intelligence analyst-turned uranium transportation executive Mark Lambert of Mount Airy, Maryland.
",-1
"Lambert, 54, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering.
",-1
"According to the DOJ: According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at “Transportation Corporation A” to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX.
",-1
"Lambert and others also allegedly used code words like “lucky figures,” “LF,” “lucky numbers,” and “cake” to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account.
",-1
"The indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation A’s services.
",-1
"In June 2015, Lambert’s former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA.
",-1
"Mikerin is currently serving a sentence of 48 months in prison and Condrey is awaiting sentencing.
",-1
"The indictment includes allegations against Lambert based on his role in effectuating the criminal scheme with Condrey, Mikerin, and others.
",-1
"We also know the following about Campbell:
",-1
"Undercover FBI informant William Campbell has given written testimony to Congressional investigators after an ""iron clad"" gag order was lifted in October
",-1
"Campbell was a highly valued CIA and FBI asset deeply embedded in the Russian nuclear industry while Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI
",-1
"while Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI Campbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money - which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian ""nuclear money laundering apparatus ""
",-1
""" He collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period, some of which detail efforts by Moscow to route money to the Clinton Foundation
",-1
"Campbell claims to have video evidence of bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.
",-1
"of bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.
",-1
"The Obama FBI knew about the bribery scheme, yet the administration still approved the Uranium One deal.
",-1
"To thank him for his service, Campbell was paid $51,000 by FBI officials at a 2016 celebration dinner in Chrystal City
",-1
"All of this then goes back to things we have pointed out with ranchers in the western united States and how this impacts them, as well as the land grabs that are unconstitutionally orchestrated by the DC government and the Bureau of Land Management.
",-1
"There is also substantial documentation that was discovered in Oregon that relates to this deal during the Oregon occupation in 2016, which got zero coverage in the mainstream media.
",-1
"Are we about to see a serious shakedown in all of this?
",-1
"Time will tell, but I remain skeptical, as in the end, all we ever get is excuses rather than justice.

"German cardinal: liturgical ‘blessing’ for gay unions is ‘truly…sacrilegious’
",-1
"NewsCatholic Church
",-1
"GERMANY, February 8, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Cardinal Paul Josef Cordes criticized fellow German Cardinal Reinhard Marx’s suggestion that Catholic priests should consider “blessing” same-sex relationships liturgically.
",-1
"Dr. Maike Hickson translated it at One Peter Five.
",-1
"“The Church is in its pastoral care bound to Holy Scripture and to its interpretation through the Church’s Magisterium,” wrote Cordes.
",-1
"Rather than being about receiving “God’s assistance for themselves,” those engaging in sodomy and wishing to have it “blessed” by the Church “aim with their request at the recognition and acceptance of their homosexual way of life and its ecclesial valorization.”
",-1
"The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that “under no circumstances” can homosexual activity “be approved” as it is “intrinsically disordered.” Such acts are “contrary to the natural law.
",-1
"They close the sexual act to the gift of life.
",-1
"They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity” (CCC 2357).
",-1
"However, Marx said on February 3 that homosexual couples need “closer pastoral care” and “one must also encourage priests and pastoral workers to give people in concrete situations [of homosexual unions] encouragement.
",-1
"I do not really see any problems there.”
",-1
"Marx is the President of the German Bishops’ Conference.
",-1
"As LifeSiteNews previously reported, Marx also said “yes,” he could imagine the creation of a rite for homosexual couples to be blessed in the Church.
",-1
"This “encouragement” from priests which he called for might include some sort of “liturgical” recognition of their union.
",-1
"But “how this would be done publicly, in a liturgical form,” is “another question...that is where one has to be reticent and also reflect upon that in a good way.”
",-1
"After Catholic News Agency’s initial report on Marx’s comments, his office contacted the outlet and said they had mistranslated part of what he said.
",-1
"The cardinal’s office sent CNA “a request for correction of [its] translation of the interview in question, expressing concern that CNA's translation constitutes a false reference and does not properly reflect the position of Cardinal Marx.”
",-1
"The cardinal’s office maintains that rather than saying “yes,” there is a possibility of liturgical “blessing” of gay unions, he answered the question in a more subtle way without giving an explicit “yes.” However, the German Bishops’ Conference doesn’t seem to deny the rest of his statements on how “one must encourage priests” to give encouragement to homosexual couples, which could include public blessings that would take a “liturgical” form.
",-1
"The cardinal’s staff asked that CNA change his answer about liturgically “blessing” gay unions to: “There are no general solutions and I think that would not be right, because we are talking about pastoral care for individual cases, and that applies to other areas as well, which we cannot regulate, where we have no sets of rules.”
",-1
"Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput has also spoken out against Marx’s proposal.
",-1
"He explained such a “blessing” would encourage people to continue living in a way the Church considers gravely sinful and spiritually damaging, and therefore would be uncharitable.
",-1
"“There is no love – no charity – without truth, just as there is no real mercy separated from a framework of justice informed and guided by truth,” he wrote.
",-1
"“Creating confusion around important truths of our faith, no matter how positive the intention, only makes a difficult task more difficult.”
",-1
"“There are two principles we need to remember,” Chaput wrote.
",-1
"This emphatically includes persons with same-sex attraction.
",-1
"Second, there is no truth, no real mercy, and no authentic compassion, in blessing a course of action that leads persons away from God.”
",-1
"“This in no way is a rejection of the persons seeking such a blessing, but rather a refusal to ignore what we know to be true about the nature of marriage, the family, and the dignity of human sexuality,” he explained.
",-1
"“Jesus said the truth will make us free.
",-1
"Nowhere did he suggest it will make us comfortable.”
",-1
"Cordes has a history of defending the Church’s moral teaching.
",-1
"Marx, one of the pope’s nine main advisors, said in 2016 that same-sex relationships have “worth” which must be recognized by the Church.

"SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case
",-1
"The press, secular as well as Catholic, is full this week of the story that the pope did indeed see evidence of Barros’ complicity in Karadima’s sexual abuse – not only that Barros had helped to cover it up but that he had been present and a direct witness at the time and therefore a passive participant.
",-1
"Pope Francis received a victim’s letter in 2015 that graphically detailed how a priest sexually abused him and how other Chilean clergy ignored it, contradicting the pope’s recent insistence that no victims had come forward to denounce the cover-up, the letter’s author and members of Francis’ own sex- abuse commission have told The Associated Press.
",-1
"The fact that Francis received the eight-page letter, obtained by the AP, challenges his insistence that he has “zero tolerance” for sex abuse and cover-ups.
",-1
"Now it appears that Francis had also overruled a 2015 warning from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that Barros should not be made a bishop.
",-1
"The Italian Catholic daily La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana reports that not only did the pope see a letter from victims, but that the CDF, under Muller, “had already conducted an preliminary investigation into Barros and the other bishops close to Karadima which had led to the decision to relieve them of their duties.”
",-1
"“But with a letter signed by the Pope in January 2015 and sent to the Chilean bishops, the request for exemption is blocked and shortly thereafter Barros is promoted to…Osorno.”
",-1
"The article points out that while Karadima was convicted by a Vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victims, it is the same testimony of the same victim-witnesses that Francis now dismisses in the accusations against Barros.
",-1
"The accusations that stood against Karadima come from the same sources as those against Barros, who the victims said was in the room watching at the time.
",-1
"While the specifics are still not known, readers may be reminded by this of a peculiar incident about a year later in which Pope Francis summarily ordered the dismissal of three priests of the CDF, whose remit was investigations of clerics accused of sexual abuse.
",-1
"The website One Peter Five reports, via Marco Tosatti, that the pope ordered their removal without offering any explanation to then-cardinal prefect Gerhard Muller.
",-1
"When, after several attempts and three months later[2], Muller was able to get an audience with the pope to ask the reason, he received the response, “I am the pope, I do not need to give reasons for any of my decisions.
",-1
"I have decided that they have to leave and they have to leave.”
",-1
"Marco Tosatti reports the CDF incident, but it follows an odd story of a meeting of curial officials to discuss certain bishop appointments.
",-1
"Without naming names, (or, frustratingly, giving dates[3]) Tosatti relates:
",-1
"“It was some time ago to make a bishop, not in Italy.
",-1
"The nuncio has prepared the triad [the “terna” or list of three candidates].
",-1
"A cardinal, head of the dicastery, perhaps the same holder of the Congregation for Bishops, during the ordinary assembly took the floor, saying: ‘The first candidate indicated is excellent, the second is good.
",-1
"But I would like to warn of the third, whom I know well, since he was a seminarian, and who presents problems both on the level of doctrine and morality.
",-1
"He responds little to the necessary criteria.
",-1
"But the third was a friend of someone and another cardinal, of the circle currently in power, has flung himself at his colleague, accusing him of impropriety.’ The meeting ended without further decisions.”
",-1
"Whatever the details of these strange incidents, what is clear in Chile is that no amount of eyewitness testimony was going to make the slightest difference.
",-1
"Bergoglio wanted Barros as a bishop and that was that.
",-1
"Even while “apologising” the pope had doubled down when questioned about it by journalists, saying, “You, in all good will, tell me that there are victims, but I haven’t seen any, because they haven’t come forward.”
",-1
"“In the case of Barros it’s been observed, it’s been studied; there’s no evidence.
",-1
"The best thing to do if someone believes it’s the case is to come forward quickly with evidence.”
",-1
"The AP report, however, says exactly the opposite; that members of his own (now defunct[4]) abuse Commission had approached Cardinal O’Malley, the pope’s “top abuse advisor,” with the letter to deliver to the pope.
",-1
"Marie Collins, the Irish abuse survivor and Commission member who resigned, citing the Vatican’s refusal to take meaningful action, told AP, “When we gave him [O’Malley] the letter for the pope, he assured us he would give it to the pope and speak of the concerns.
",-1
"On the face of it, there are only a few logical possibilities here.
",-1
"In fact, unless Cardinal O’Malley – who has, as of this writing, remained silent – comes forward and says that he didn’t hand the letter over pope, there is really only one; that the pope lied.
",-1
"And this is what is now being said quite openly by a vast array of voices, secular and Catholic, left and right.
",-1
"As Winfield writes,
",-1
"“The revelation could be costly for Francis, whose track record on the abuse crisis was already shaky after a botched Italian abuse case he intervened in became public[5].
",-1
"More recently, he let the abuse commission lapse at the end of last year.
",-1
"Vatican analysts now openly question whether he ‘gets it,’ and some of his own advisers privately acknowledge that maybe he doesn’t.”
",-1
"It was made in response to a question by a journalist about Monsignore Battista Ricca – a prelate whose promiscuous homosexuality is so well known it was covered by the Telegraph as early as July 2013.
",-1
"Ilze Scamparini asked the pope about Ricca, saying, “What you intend to do about this?
",-1
"How are you confronting this issue and how does Your Holiness intend to confront the whole question of the gay lobby?”
",-1
"What reply did Bergoglio give?
",-1
"His standard one: “No evidence.”
",-1
"About Monsignor Ricca: I did what canon law calls for, that is a preliminary investigation.
",-1
"And from this investigation, there was nothing of what had been alleged.
",-1
"We did not find anything of that.
",-1
"This is the response.”
",-1
"He added, “In this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn’t find anything.”
",-1
"But Ricca’s activities, for which the pope claimed there was no evidence, were notorious.
",-1
"They include being caught in flagrante in an elevator with a teenaged male prostitute, and his sexual relationship with a captain in the Swiss army.
",-1
"It was reported in 1999 and 2000 by L’Espresso, who said the information was confirmed by “numerous bishops, priests, religious and laity” in Uruguay[6].
",-1
"In fact, the evidence shows that Ricca is completely in line with Bergoglio’s normal procedures.
",-1
"And in case anyone was wondering what will happen next, the same advice said to keep on lying after you’re caught.
",-1
"The pattern of silence and, when pressed, flat-out denial has been Bergoglio’s policy since long before he came on the international scene.
",-1
"He has a long record in Argentina of shaving close to scandals and vociferously denying involvement, and relying heavily on the broad good will of Catholics towards bishops to pull it off.
",-1
"Perhaps his biggest error with Barros was failing to understand just how little of that capital of trust there is left in the Catholic world as a whole.
",-1
"Indeed, on the subject of priests sexually abusing young people, it could only be measured in the negative numbers.
",-1
"“Argentine Victims Who Tried to Meet with Pope Francis…”
",-1
"Though the website Bishop Accountability is blatantly anti-clerical, their data is unassailable since most of it comes from information that is already public.
",-1
"On their Argentina page is a long list of accusations that Bergoglio/Francis simply isn’t interested in hearing from victims.
",-1
"“In Pope Francis’s 21 years as bishop and archbishop of Buenos Aires, the Wall Street Journal reports, including the years when he headed the Argentine bishops’ conference, he declined to meet with victims of sexual abuse.”
",-1
"“All of them tried to contact the cardinal archbishop in 2002 or later,” the same period when Pope Benedict and other bishops were striving to meet with victims and demonstrate an interest in the problem.
",-1
"The site says that “in addition to Bergoglio’s failure to respond to victims, the public record contains no evidence that he released any information about abusers.”
",-1
"In fact, he went so far as to flatly deny there had been any instances of abuse in his archdiocese.
",-1
"Weeks after his election to the papacy, he was quoted by his close friend, Rabbi Abraham Skorka, “In my diocese it never happened to me, but a bishop called me once by phone to ask me what to do in a situation like this.” Francis added that he agreed with the “zero tolerance” attitude of the Irish episcopate and admired Pope Benedict’s reforms – most of which he was later to quietly reverse.
",-1
"It was at exactly this time, however, that victims from Argentina were attempting to get the new pope’s attention.
",-1
"One, known to the press only as “Gabriel,” wanted to talk to Francis about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of Julio César Grassi, accused of molesting at least five boys, “who has been avoiding the sentences of the justice of Morón and the Court of Cassation.
",-1
"So far, judges and prosecutors at all instances found him guilty.”
",-1
"In case anyone thinks the Grassi-Gabriel case was not serious enough for the pope’s attention, Bishop Accountability summarises, “A year after Gabriel had filed criminal charges [2003] but before the start of Grassi’s trial, three men ransacked the survivor’s apartment and beat him.” These men threatened to kill him if he did not retract his testimony and quit the case.
",-1
"Ten years [after Gabriel filed criminal charges], in May 2013, with Grassi still free despite his conviction in 2009, “Gabriel and his attorney, Juan Pablo Gallego, brought a two-page letter addressed to Pope Francis to the office of the papal nuncio in Buenos Aires.
",-1
"An employee refused to accept the letter after learning of its topic and threatened to call security if Gabriel and Gallego did not leave the premises.”
",-1
"The group surmises that it was Bergoglio’s direct intervention with judges in the case that prevented a conviction against Grassi for so long and delayed his sentencing through multiple appeals.
",-1
"In 2006, then-Archbishop Bergoglio complained of a “media campaign” and claimed that the Grassi case was “different” from other accusations.
",-1
"During his criminal trial Grassi said Bergoglio “never let go” of his hand.
",-1
"In 2009, Grassi was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault and corruption in the case of “Gabriel,” who was aged 13 at the time of the abuse, but the appeals dragged on until he was finally sent to prison in September 2013.
",-1
"Several more similar cases, all of whom were rebuffed in their attempts to meet with Bergoglio, are detailed here, for the strong-of-stomach.
",-1
"It is arguable that even the members of the so-called “San Gallen Mafia” who apparently conspired to put him on Peter’s throne were used by him.
",-1
"But he is also a master of judging an audience and telling them what they expect to hear; a key skill for all grifters and confidence tricksters.
",-1
"Looking carefully at the infamous “Who am I to judge” comment, this was clear early on.
",-1
"Recall that this was the very first airplane interview, on the trip back to Rome from World Youth Day in Rio, a matter of weeks after his election.
",-1
"But perhaps in hindsight, we are ready to examine the full implications of his little speech, one that was clearly well-rehearsed.
",-1
"Journalists must submit their questions well in advance.)
",-1
"Read his full answer carefully:
",-1
"I see that many times in the Church, over and above this case, but including this case, people search for “sins from youth”, for example, and then publish them.
",-1
"They are not crimes, right?
",-1
"Crimes are something different: the abuse of minors is a crime.
",-1
"No, sins.
",-1
"But if a person, whether it be a lay person, a priest or a religious sister, commits a sin and then converts, the Lord forgives, and when the Lord forgives, the Lord forgets and this is very important for our lives.
",-1
"When we confess our sins and we truly say, “I have sinned in this”, the Lord forgets, and so we have no right not to forget, because otherwise we would run the risk of the Lord not forgetting our sins.
",-1
"This is important: a theology of sin.
",-1
"Many times I think of Saint Peter.
",-1
"He committed one of the worst sins, that is he denied Christ, and even with this sin they made him Pope.
",-1
"We have to think a great deal about that.
",-1
"But, returning to your question more concretely.
",-1
"In this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn’t find anything.
",-1
"This is the first question.
",-1
"Then, you spoke about the gay lobby.
",-1
"So much is written about the gay lobby.
",-1
"I still haven’t found anyone with an identity card in the Vatican with “gay” on it.
",-1
"They say there are some there.
",-1
"I believe that when you are dealing with such a person, you must distinguish between the fact of a person being gay and the fact of someone forming a lobby, because not all lobbies are good.
",-1
"This one is not good.
",-1
"The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this in a beautiful way, saying ... wait a moment, how does it say it ... it says: “no one should marginalize these people for this, they must be integrated into society”.
",-1
"The problem is not having this tendency, no, we must be brothers and sisters to one another, and there is this one and there is that one.
",-1
"For me, this is the greater problem.
",-1
"Thank you so much for asking this question.
",-1
"Many thanks.
",-1
"One of the pope’s favourite rhetorical techniques is a combination of Begging the Question and conspiracy.
",-1
"He starts by assuming, without any effort at defence or explanation, a point that concedes the whole issue.
",-1
"This was the first time a pope had ever used the political term “gay”.
",-1
"Not “homosexual,” not “same-sex attracted,” but “gay,” meaning that he started by adopting the entirety of the homosexualist movement’s linguistic manipulations.
",-1
"In this case too, he was addressing a plane load of journalists who were either secular themselves, or for the most part are the kind of Catholic who believes it is fine to “disagree” with Catholic teaching on sexuality.
",-1
"There are very few “conservative” Catholics in the Vatican journalist pool.
",-1
"This astonishing departure follows an implied but very clear assertion that Ricca has repented and given up his activity, an assertion that has absolutely no evidence to back it up.
",-1
"“The problem is not having this tendency.” Well, actually, your holiness, yes it is, particularly in the case of priests.
",-1
"A few months ago in a piece for the Remnant, I talked about why the Church (and nearly all human societies) regard lying as a sin:
",-1
"A mistake many make about lying is to understand it only in terms of morality.
",-1
"But Thomas makes the point that it is first a matter of metaphysics.
",-1
"Lying is an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality.
",-1
"Thomistic theology teaches that it is by lying that we become most like the devil, and most unlike God, because we are trying to change the nature of reality to suit our own purposes.
",-1
"Habitual lying in effect changes you into a different kind of being, one that is by nature an opponent of Truth, ordered against Truth.
",-1
"This of course means that a person whose “orientation,” as we might say, is towards falsehood, even when he is at any given moment saying something true, is still servicing his lies.
",-1
"He tells the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality.
",-1
"It was not by violence, but by lying and manipulation, by issuing half-truths and pretending to be the kind of man he was not, that Shakespeare’s character Iago earned the title of most evil character in English literature.
",-1
"Human beings are naturally ordered towards the truth, and we have to work at assuming a lie.
",-1
"This is why confidence tricksters can be successful, why lying works for getting what you want; people don’t see it coming.
",-1
"The first natural assumption is trust, at least at the basic level of expecting truth most of the time.
",-1
"We therefore instinctively see lying as a betrayal of trust.
",-1
"Sociologists talk about the concept of the “high trust society,” one in which citizens believe what they are told by the elites and trust them to govern and protect them adequately.
",-1
"This is the way societies disintegrate.
",-1
"It has been said many times that the sex abuse crisis has created a massive loss of trust in prelates among the Catholic faithful, and this is true.
",-1
"Are we seeing it already?
",-1
"Are we seeing it in the declarations of this or that episcopate on Amoris Laetitia and Communion for divorced and civilly remarried Catholics?
",-1
"With Cardinal Marx and others promoting “blessings” for “same-sex unions” are we going to be seeing an escalation of it?
",-1
"I am told from contacts inside the Vatican that after the trip to Chile Bergoglio’s support has completely dried up.
",-1
"Marie Collins, by no stretch even a “conservative” Catholic, echoed this concern, saying the Barros affair has “definitely undermined credibility, trust, and hope” in Francis.
",-1
"“All I can say is that people who had a lot of hope in this particular pope, and I am talking about just ordinary Catholics that I know in my own parish, would find it very difficult now…and cannot understand and cannot believe that this particular pope has said the things he has said in the last few weeks,” she told the National Catholic Reporter.
",-1
"There is a multitude of problems this pontificate has created or made worse that we will be dealing with for a long time after Bergoglio is gone, but perhaps one of the bigger ones will be the destruction of trust.
",-1
"Notes:
",-1
"[1] “Not one victim has come forward in Chile; show me the proof.
",-1
"[2] The book “The Dictator Pope” relates that regular meetings between the pope and dicastery heads have been abolished and even high-ranking curia prefects are often unable to see the pope, whose appointments are now completely controlled by the Secretariat of State.
",-1
"It is certainly clear that no one sees the pope unless Cardinal Parolin approves, which may be the reason Cardinal Zen, in his efforts to warn Francis of the dangers of a Vatican deal with the communist Chinese government had to wait in the rain at a Wednesday general audience.
",-1
"[3] This is common in Italian journalism that has somewhat different standards from that of the Anglo world… and drives the rest of us spare.
",-1
"Italians care about getting a general picture of what’s going on, where Anglo-Saxons are considered weirdly obsessed with trivial details.
",-1
"[4] Though she never blamed the pope, Marie Collins complained that Vatican officialdom had simply not implemented the Commission’s recommendations.
",-1
"The time limit of the Commission’s members was allowed to lapse without renewal and though it was not dissolved formally the Commission has ceased to function with no word of any plan to revive it.
",-1
"[5] Probably a reference to the Inzoli case in which Francis overturned a previous sentence of a Vatican tribunal after the priest – now laicised – approached some of the pope’s close advisors for help, including Cardinal Coccopalmerio.
",-1
"Sandro Magister reported after the “Who am I to judge” comment, “Before the appointment, Francis had been shown, as is customary, the personal file on Ricca, in which he had not found anything unseemly.
",-1
"He had also heard from various personalities of the curia, and none of them had raised objections.”
",-1
"In what is being considered a particularly rare event, scientists are projecting that the Sun will be an unusually cool customer by the year 2050.
",-1
"By combining data and observations from decades of Sun research, experts are predicting a “Grand Solar Minimum” will occur a few decades from now, making our parent star dimmer and cooler than it has been for a very long time.
",-1
"The Sun might look the same to you today as it has since the first time you laid eyes on it, but our star actually displays plenty of changes.
",-1
"The Sun goes through regular cycles of solar minimums and solar maximums, which are periods where the Sun is either quite calm (the minimum) or incredibly active (the maximum).
",-1
"These patterns repeat every 11 years or so, but new research suggests that there’s a pattern behind the pattern, and that a particularly cool solar minimum is on the way.
",-1
"The study, which was published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, was carried out by a team led by physicist Dan Lubin of the University of California, San Diego.
",-1
"After combing the data, Lubin’s team has forecasted a grand minimum that will be around seven percent cooler than the typical solar minimum, making it a particularly calm moment for our star.
",-1
"During a solar minimum, the Sun produces far fewer solar flares and sunspots, and as a result, much less ultraviolet radiation is shot out into space and towards Earth.
",-1
"This can have a number of effects on our planet, including changes in the thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer and temperatures far above ground.
",-1
"Those changes can affect weather, though forecasting specific differences has proven difficult.
",-1
"The grand minimum will be an exaggerated version of the typical solar minimum, and could produce some very noticeable effects.
",-1
"The most recent grand minimum is thought to have occurred back in the mid 1600s.
",-1
"The event, called the Maunder Minimum, is credited with plunging temperatures to the point where the Thames River and Baltic Sea froze over.
",-1
"However, other parts of the planet heated up, including Alaska and Greenland, to far above their normal highs.
",-1
"This temporary shakeup of temperatures could happen again, though the researchers say it will have very little effect on the overall global warming trend that mankind has created for itself.

"Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government
",-1
"The McGill student at the centre of anti-Semitic allegations says he’s certain the climate within student government will improve, after a report into the incident was made public this week.
",-1
"Noah Lew and two other students were voted off the Students’ Society of McGill University last October after they were identified as having pro-Israel viewpoints.
",-1
"They were since reinstated.
",-1
"A report made public this week by Spencer Boudreau concluded he could not determine if students who organized against the three board members had anti-Semitic intentions.
",-1
"Boudreau, a retired professor of education and former ombudsperson for students, however, said he understood why the students felt they were targeted because they are Jewish.
",-1
"After criticism from several Jewish groups both on and off campus, Boudreau issued a clarification to the report, saying he could not determine if the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism, but he acknowledged there were “in fact anti-Semitic effects felt by members of the Jewish community.”
",-1
"Speaking to the Montreal Gazette on Friday, Lew, the SSMU’s vice-president of finance for the Arts, said he was initially upset with the report, but felt vindicated by Boudreau’s clarification.
",-1
"“I thought this acknowledgement was very important and I really did appreciate that he clarified the matter,” he said.
",-1
"Jewish groups had criticized Boudreau’s report, saying it ignored anti-Semitic language used on Facebook by a group called Democratize SSMU.
",-1
"Boudreau made his clarification after it was pointed out the anti-Semitic language was published prior to the vote.
",-1
"While Democratize SSMU later apologized for the language and deleted it from its site, the damage had already been done, Boudreau concluded.
",-1
"Lew said he feels vindicated to some extent, but is concerned anti-Semitism is still a problem within student government.
",-1
"“There have been some steps taken by the administration and the student body in the right direction, but it’s certainly not over,” he said.
",-1
"Among the measures taken by SSMU after the October vote was the creation of a committee looking into the issue of anti-Semitism within the student government, which Lew sits on.
",-1
"On Wednesday, McGill Principal Suzanne Fortier said the University wants to ensure a safe space for all students.
",-1
"In addition to ordering the report, Fortier set up a hotline to report incidents of of intolerance and a task force to investigate incidents of academic freedom and equity.
",-1
"Rabbi Reuben Poupko, the co-chair for Quebec of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, said it should be noted McGill in general is a safe space for Jewish students.
",-1
"Democratize SSMU did not respond to a request for an interview.

"“Our presidency has taken a stand: we cannot give in to extortion,"" Orban said in a video statement on Facebook.
",-1
"Elnökségi ülés után Elnökségi ülés után // After the meeting of the presidency Posted by Orbán Viktor on Wednesday, February 7, 2018
",-1
"""The presidency of Fidesz has discussed yesterday the announcement of the Belgian Prime Minister, that they will – if necessary with force – obligate Central European countries, including Hungary, to accept migrants,” Orban stated.
",-1
"“According to their plan, this will happen in June at the summit of the prime ministers in Brussels,"" he added.
",-1
"“Our presidency has taken a stand: we cannot give in to extortion.
",-1
"According to the Hungarian Government's website, posted about the ultimatum that was given over the weekend.
",-1
"Over the weekend, Belgian prime minister Charles Michel spoke about sending “an ultimatum” to the Visegrád countries which “reject solidarity”.
",-1
"The essence of this ultimatum would be that if by the end of June a consensus is not reached in the council of EU heads of government, then the planned reforms would be adopted with a qualified majority vote which would overrule dissenters.
",-1
"Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó said on Tuesday,“Hungary will not become an immigrant country, it has never admitted and will never admit illegal immigrants.""
",-1
"“We regard this whole thing as unacceptable and we reject it,"" he added.
",-1
"“The countries of the Visegrád Group do not support the introduction of any kind of mandatory quota.”
",-1
"Just this week, we reported that Hungary had grown weary of the talks of pushing illegal Muslim migrants on their country and Europe, and was preparing to walk away from the negotiating table.
",-1
"Orban has taken a tough stance in Hungary.
",-1
"He has ordered all illegal Muslim invaders to get out of Hungary and never come back.
",-1
"In December, he said that he was not concerned with what Brussels wanted, but was determined to defend Hungary's borders.
",-1
"PM Orban has done just that, too.
",-1
"Orban's border wall virtually eliminated illegal immigration.

"Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid
",-1
"By Nick Brown
",-1
"Feb 9 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico said on Friday it will receive $16 billion in federal aid under a disaster recovery package signed on Friday by U.S. President Donald Trump.
",-1
"That money includes nearly $7 billion announced on Wednesday and will help the bankrupt U.S. territory recover from September's Hurricane Maria, according to a statement on Friday from Governor Ricardo Rossello and Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's nonvoting member of the U.S. Congress.
",-1
"Rossello said on Wednesday that Puerto Rico would get $4.9 billion to shore up its near-insolvent Medicaid system and another $2 billion or so under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to repair its destroyed electric grid.
",-1
"On Friday, Rossello and Gonzalez said the island would receive a total of $11 billion under CDBG, a program run by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
",-1
"The additional portion would be used to help local businesses and repair and build new homes, they said.
",-1
"In addition to a slow recovery from Hurricane Maria, its worst natural disaster in 90 years, Puerto Rico is navigating the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, with a combined $120 billion in bond and pension debt.
",-1
"Congress could also appropriate more money later.
",-1
"The governor has asked Congress for $46 billion in CDBG funding alone.
",-1
"""The work carried out in Washington - together with resident commissioner Jenniffer González - was able to deliver the message of the urgency of an allocation of funds that meets the needs of the Island,"" the governor said in Friday's statement.
",-1
"The disaster aid package signed by Trump on Friday - around $90 billion in total - covers a number of major disasters, including Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria, as well as the recent California wildfires.

"PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study
",-1
"Scientists say our Sun will likely enter a cooldown cycle as soon as 2050, but the phase has almost no effect on global warming.
",-1
"Physicist Dan Lubin at the University of California San Diego and two of his colleges managed to collect and observe relevant data for the past 20 years and came to the conclusion that the giant burning ball of gas in our planetary system might enter a “grand minimum” period of decreased ultraviolet radiation that would last for some 11 years by mid-century.
",-1
"“The cooldown… [is] a periodic event during which the Sun’s magnetism diminishes, sunspots form infrequently, and less ultraviolet radiation (UV) makes it to the surface of the planet,” researchers noted in a statement earlier this week, adding that “the event is triggered at irregular intervals by random fluctuations related to the Sun’s magnetic field.”
",-1
"The study, whose results were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said the Sun is likely to be 6.9 percent cooler than its usual lowest amount of activity in the grand minimum.
",-1
"According to the researchers, the cooldown phase could echo those experienced in Europe in the mid-17th century, called the “Maunder Minimum,” or the prolonged sunspot minimum, during which temperatures were low enough to cause London's River Thames to freeze over on a regular basis and to freeze the Baltic Sea to such an extent that Swedish troops were able to invade Denmark in 1658 on foot by marching across the sea ice.
",-1
"However, scientists warned that it should not be assumed that the ultra-cooling of the sun would potentially prevent the negative effects of global warming.
",-1
"“The cooling effect of a grand minimum is only a fraction of the warming effect caused by the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,” they said, adding, “After hundreds of thousands of years of CO2 levels never exceeding 300 parts per million in air, the concentration of the greenhouse gas is now over 400 parts per million, continuing a rise that began with the Industrial Revolution.”
",-1
"The study estimated that the Sun’s mid-century cooldown would probably only result in cooling the Earth by some 0.25 percent between 2020 and 2070.
",-1
"As a result, the temperature at the surface of our cosmic home would decrease by up to several tenths of a degree Celsius, which is not sufficient to stop global warming, but it could at least soften its effects in part.
",-1
"“Now we have a benchmark from which we can perform better climate model simulations.
",-1
"We can therefore have a better idea of how changes in solar UV radiation affect climate change,” said Lubin.

"According to Zakkout, who sits on the boards of two anti-crime groups, Anderson’s declaration “makes a lot of sense.” With statements like this from Zakkout and worse, why would groups committed to fighting crime continue to compromise themselves and sabotage their mission by affiliating with him?
",-1
"Sofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA), a prominent Islamic organization headquartered in North Miami Beach, Florida.
",-1
"On January 25th, Zakkout posted onto his personal Facebook page a video clip of a speech made by Steve Anderson, the pastor of the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona.
",-1
"Anderson is notorious for calling for the killing of gays to end AIDS.
",-1
"In the clip, Anderson states the following: “And the Jews were scattered into all nations for literally 2000 years, right?
",-1
"For 1800 sum odd years.
",-1
"And by the way, everywhere they were scattered, they were persecuted, hated, treated badly.
",-1
"‘Cause God’s blessing them?
",-1
"No.
",-1
"‘Cause they’re under the curse of God for having rejected the Lord Jesus Christ.”
",-1
"Indeed, statements and beliefs such as Anderson’s have provoked hatred and persecution of Jews.
",-1
"Towards the end of the clip, which is less than four minutes in length, Anderson throws the anti-Semitism in people’s faces.
",-1
"He zealously states, while drawing laughter from his small audience, “You say, ‘Why are you preaching against the Jews?’ Well, don’t come back next Wednesday night.
",-1
"Because, next Wednesday night, God’s wrath is on the Jews even more!”
",-1
"Both Anderson and Zakkout have been denounced by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for their propagation of anti-Semitism.
",-1
"In July 2010, the ADL condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring an anti-Jewish video produced by former KKK leader and white supremacist David Duke on the AMANA website.
",-1
"Besides posting videos from Steve Anderson and David Duke on his Facebook page, Zakkout also, in July 2017, posted a four minute clip from a speech made by Nation of Islam (NOI) leader Louis Farrakhan.
",-1
"Zakkout is also an ardent supporter of the terrorist organization Hamas, if not a member himself.
",-1
"In July 2014, he organized a pro-Hamas rally held outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Miami.
",-1
"Sofian Zakkout.” The next month, Zakkout declared in Arabic, ""Hamas is in my heart and on my head.""
",-1
"All of the above testifies to hatred and intolerance, but it is even more disturbing given the fact that Zakkout sits on the boards of two anti-crime organizations: Crime Stoppers of Miami-Dade County and Citizens’ Crime Watch of Miami-Dade County.
",-1
"Serving alongside Zakkout on these boards are local politicians and law enforcement officials.
",-1
"One would think that they would find Zakkout’s actions and bigotry unacceptable, as well, yet Zakkout continues to serve unchallenged.

"Once and for all, these groups need to divorce themselves from Zakkout and repudiate what he stands for.

"'Oumuamua: Space Cigar Is Still Spinning From Mysterious Violent Collision
",-1
"And the interstellar object will continue to spin for billions of years as it journeys through space, scientists have reported in a study published in Nature Astronomy.
",-1
"This is the latest of several revelations following the first-ever discovery of a solar system invader last October.
",-1
"Initially believed to be a comet, then an asteroid, scientists think the wandering “interstellar object” is a hunk of ice wrapped in organic sun-blocking material.
",-1
"M Kornmesser/ESO/Flickr
",-1
"""At some point or another it's been in a collision,"" Queen's University, Belfast, research fellow and lecturer Wes Fraser told the BBC.
",-1
"The research team watched 'Oumuamua’s brightness change over time to model exactly how it was spinning.
",-1
"'Oumuamua “appears to be in an excited rotational state undergoing non-principal axis rotation” the study authors wrote.
",-1
"This unusual “excited” movement is better known as “tumbling.”
",-1
"“Tumbling is an unusual state of rotation,” Fraser said during Sunday’s episode of the BBC’s long-running Sky at Night show.
",-1
"“It quickly starts to wobble around chaotically.”
",-1
"The icy cigar was probably knocked askew by a violent collision with another object.
",-1
"The researchers don’t know exactly when this happened, but suspect it took place before 'Oumuamua left its home stellar system.
",-1
"""It's hard to know if it was during planet formation or after the planet formation process,"" Fraser said during the show.
",-1
"""Certainly, more collisions happen while planets are growing than afterwards, so that’s a very good guess.
",-1
"But unfortunately we can’t get a high-resolution image of this thing to see what kind of crater is on it that might be attributed to the collision that caused it to start tumbling.""
",-1
"The team think 'Oumuamua may eventually move less chaotically.
",-1
"""The tumbling actually causes stresses and strains internal to the object, and that slowly but surely squeezes and pulls on the object just like tides on the Earth to remove energy from the spin,"" Fraser said.
",-1
"But, at least for the next few billion years, the space invader is destined to continue its topsy-turvy spin.
",-1
"So, just how far is “the farthest ever”?
",-1
"Right around 3.79 billion miles.
",-1
"There are three images in total, each focusing on a different distant object.
",-1
"The subjects include the ‘Wishing Well’ star cluster as well as two large objects in the Kuiper Belt which have never been observed from such a distance before.
",-1
"The images, as seen above (Kuiper Belt objects) and below (Wishing Well cluster), are somewhat grainy and not the most detailed we’ve seen from NASA, but that doesn’t make the feat any less remarkable.
",-1
"New Horizons originally launched way back in early 2006, and it the spacecraft has made close passes of a number of planets during its more than a decade of cruising through our Solar System.
",-1
"Its primary mission was set to last roughly 10 years, but was extended once it became clear that the spacecraft was healthy enough to continue sending back observations for a while longer.
",-1
"Its new extended mission will wrap up in early 2021 after it performs a number of flybys of large objects in the Kuiper Belt that scientists want to learn more about.

"Yore, who has handled child abuse investigations and clergy abuse investigations throughout her legal career, was commenting on the latest sexual abuse case to touch the Francis papacy, in this case where the Pope appointed a bishop with a history of complicity in child sex abuse.
",-1
"The Pope’s claim that he had never received any victim testimony regarding the complicity of Chilean Bishop Juan Barros in child sex abuse has proven to be false.
",-1
"Yore said that not only is it now known that the Pope received a letter from one of the victims, but it is also now known that he was “told from the moment he appointed Bishop Barros in 2015 that this was a bad decision.”
",-1
"“The Chilean Archbishop conference told him to revoke this appointment.
",-1
"He received petitions and letters and calls, yet, ignored them all,” she said.
",-1
"As details continue to surface, the pontiff’s professed empathy for abuse victims has come into question as well.
",-1
"The scandal signals that the Church under Francis is slipping backwards in its handling of abuse, said Yore.
",-1
"Yore called the example Pope Francis set in the way he handled the abuse information “extremely dangerous.”
",-1
"Reports say Pope Francis personally received the eight-page letter from the Chilean victim graphically detailing the alleged abuses by Karadima and linking Barros as having witnessed and covered up the abuse.
",-1
"The alleged abuse took place decades prior to Francis’s 2015 appointment of Barros to the Diocese of Osorno in southern Chile.
",-1
"Pope Francis received the victim’s letter in 2015, its author and a member of Francis’s sex abuse commission have said, contradicting the Pope’s recent insistence that no victims had come forward in the matter and no evidence had been produced.
",-1
"The Pope later said he would send Malta Archbishop Charles Scicluna – the former top Vatican abuse investigator - to Chile to investigate the matter.
",-1
"Expectations were high in 2014 when the Pope created the abuse commission.
",-1
"And while he has continually condemned clergy sex abuse throughout his pontificate, some have argued his actions in some serious cases don’t match his tough stances on abuse.
",-1
"Four members of the commission had met with Cardinal O’Malley in 2015, conveying their objections to Francis’s 2015 appointment of Barros as bishop of Osorno.
",-1
"It was at the meeting with O’Malley that the abuse commission representatives reportedly gave the letter to the cardinal to deliver to Francis, and O’Malley later confirmed to a commission member that he had in fact personally delivered the letter to the Pope.
",-1
"Yore explained that the Pope has been told from the moment he appointed Barros in 2015 that it was a bad decision, between the Chilean bishops’ conference, petitions, letters and calls, that were all ignored.
",-1
"Further, a Chilean judicial inquiry found all the victims who testified — including the letter’s author Juan Carlos — to be credible, and that there was a major cover-up of the abuse by Father Karadima.
",-1
"Cruz recounted how he and other victims had been dismissed or slandered by local Church hierarchy for numerous attempts to be heard.
",-1
"And he spoke about holding out hope that there would be a different response from the Pope, discussing specifics of getting the letter to the Francis via Cardinal O’Malley.
",-1
"Cruz told Arroyo he was really hurt and felt betrayed by the Pope’s comments that the accusations were slander, and there were no witnesses or evidence.
",-1
"“To hear him talk about us that way,” Cruz said, “calling us slanderers, it was terrible because it set the clock back for so many victims.”
",-1
"Scicluna will be meeting with Cruz, who said he hopes other abuse survivors will be heard as a result of his case coming more to the forefront.
",-1
"“This leaves us with very strong evidence that the Pope was, in fact, aware of what has happened,” Yore said.
",-1
"“This is Barros present, in the room when the abuse is ongoing with these young minor boys.”
",-1
"She said she would argue as a child advocate that Barros was involved in sexual exploitation of children.
",-1
"“So I don’t think this is simply just a case, as bad as it is, of a cover-up of an abuser,” she said.
",-1
"Yore said that given the Church’s sex abuse crisis, one would have thought going into the 2013 conclave (which elected Francis) that an obvious priority in vetting candidates for the papacy would have meant a serious look at their history of handling abuse allegations in their previous sees.
",-1
"There are more cases out there just like Barros that have been covered up, Yore told Arroyo, maybe even some even worse than the Barros case.
",-1

"Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions
",-1
"SALZBURG, Austria, February 13, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – The indignation about Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode – the President and the Vice President of the German Bishops' Conference – and their direct or more indirect encouragement of blessing homosexual unions is growing by the day.
",-1
"Now Bishop emeritus Andreas Laun – one of the signatories of the Kazakh “Profession of Truth about Sacramental Marriage” – has written a strong commentary for the Austrian Catholic news website Kath.net on the recent episcopal initiatives coming out of Germany.
",-1
"In the following, we shall present to our readers the essential parts of Bishop Laun's statement, in our English translation from the German.
",-1
"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
",-1
"A clear statement by Bishop Andreas Laun for Kath.net.
",-1
"Cardinal Marx and also Bishop Bode have now opened up to the idea to offer homosexual couples a blessing.
",-1
"Why not, one could say, since the Church is ready to bless nearly everything on the earth?
",-1
"Now, the Church especially blesses people, but also deeds and objects.
",-1
"The Jesuit Father Eckhard Bieger writes in the Internet about Catholic blessings:
",-1
"For Catholics, really everything can be blessed, not only places of worship, chalices, and the faithful after each prayer service – whether after a Mass, or after the prayers for the hours of the day.
",-1
"The blessing is also not limited to rosaries or religious medal, but one may also bless cars, factory halls, animals, herbs, and much more.
",-1
"Some blessings are only to be made by priests and deacons, especially when it is about objects of worship such as chalices or vestments.
",-1
"But parents can bless their children.
",-1
"The faithful may also take home holy water and sprinkle it on members of the family, but also the stable and the animals, thus blessing them.
",-1
"[...]
",-1
"What kind of hope is connected with a blessing?
",-1
"With regard to the car, certainly the wish for heavenly protection – sometimes also expressed with the help of a medal of St. Christopher, the patron saint of car drivers.
",-1
"With the weather blessing, one prays explicitly for protection against hail, lightning and drought.
",-1
"The blessing comes from God, He is being addressed in the form of a request; and it is given to people, objects, and buildings, with the help of the sign of the cross, holy water, and incense.
",-1
"But now concerning the question of Cardinal Marx, and not a few of the priests, the answer is simple: one may ask for God's blessing for sinners, but not for the sin.
",-1
"Therefore it is clear that one may not bless a relationship which is sinful; [one may not bless] the mafia; no blessing for organizations or institutions which promote or procure abortions or which propagate ideologies which are against the Faith, antisemitic contents, or other forms of racist thought.
",-1
"Of course [one could bless] two men or women who are de facto homosexual, and that it what happens in each Holy Mass which is being attended by them.
",-1
"This blessing – which is not related to their acts – is being received also by all the other sinners, and the Church thereby hopes that they will convert under the influence of God's Grace!
",-1
"I am sure there are many many others, too, who think alike, but whom I do not know.
",-1
"And your addition “in individual cases” is absolutely worthless, it has no argumentative force.
",-1
"What would St. John the Baptist have said if Herod, taking for himself his brother's wife, would have excusingly called himself an “individual case”!
",-1
"The idea to bless sinful conduct is really what Isaiah described quite vividly, as follows: “Woe to you that call evil good, and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.” [Isaiah 5:20]
",-1
"Is this not exactly what Cardinal Marx – and others who are thinking like him – are doing?
",-1
"If one were to place on a bottle of sour cucumbers a tag “honey,” the cucumbers still remain sour!
",-1
"Even blessing bishops cannot change that.
",-1
"Nor can the pope, in calling for a cultural revolution, especially since he does not explain what he exactly means by it.
",-1
"He says that he “allows himself” to talk like that – but if one dares something, one might win, but one also can perish.
",-1
"That seems to catch on these days.
",-1
"For example, the Italian moral theologian, Maurizio Chiodi, recently claimed in his talk at the Gregorian Pontifical University that contraception is sometimes not only not forbidden, but even demanded!
",-1
"Isaiah says that such people draw unto them God's punishment, with thick cords!
",-1
"Nevertheless, one should wish for Cardinal Marx, Bishop Bode, and Professor Chiodi that they sleep well.
",-1
"Whether their conscience will allow it, is not so certain; but if it does not [allow it], it would certainly be a hope for their conversion.

"Cardinal Müller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an ‘atrocity’
",-1
"BRATISLAVA, Slovakia, February 13, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Former Vatican doctrine chief Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller has decried the Church's current adaptation to the modern world and rejected the idea of blessing homosexual couples.
",-1
"The remarks, made in a February 6 talk in Slovakia, indirectly respond to new initiatives coming from Germany, especially from Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode.
",-1
"Cardinal Müller, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, spoke at a conference on John Paul II's encyclical Veritatis Splendor at the Comenius University in Bratislava, organized by the Slovakian Bishops' Conference.
",-1
"In this context, the German cardinal also criticized Martin Luther's own denial of man's free will and his teaching about the total depravity of man that separates morality from the relationship with God.
",-1
"Morality, Müller explained, is rooted in Grace; that is why any teaching about “rules and exceptions” ignores the character of the ethics of the Covenant and of Grace.
",-1
"In the discussion following his talk, Cardinal Müller also responded to questions concerning Pope Francis' post-synodal exhortation, Amoris Laetitia.
",-1
"The cardinal said that he is “not happy” about the fact that there are different interpretations of this papal text by some bishops' conferences.
",-1
"Contradictory conceptions concerning the Sacraments, said the cardinal, lead into chaotic conditions.
",-1
"Archbishop Stanislav Zvolensy, President of the Slovakian Bishops' Conference and archbishop of Bratislava, told Die Tagespost that Veritatis Splendor is not only still valid, but shows timeless truths.
",-1
"Promulgated 25 years ago, the encyclical rejects authoritatively the theory of situation ethics, a theory that seems to be getting again much attention in our time, for example by theologians such as Professor Maurizio Chiodi.
",-1
"Professor Livio Melina, the former President of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and the Family, was another speaker at the February 6 conference.
",-1
"He stressed that Amoris Laetitia has to be “read in the context of the magisterial instructions of the encyclical Veritatis Splendor, which recalls the connection between conscience and truth, as well as the necessity of a well-formed conscience.” In returning to that encyclical, explained the Italian professor and theologian, Amoris Laetitia could be given a hermeneutic in light of a “continuity with the Magisterium of the Church.” He also said: “The Commandments are an expression of the Love of God for us.
",-1
"If we fulfill them, we are united with God.”

"Puerto Rico Hurricane Recovery Worsened By Nearly 1 Million Homes Built Illegally
",-1
"But even before the hurricane, housing in the U.S. territory—where 43.5 percent of people live below the poverty line—was in crisis, and many homes on the island were built with salvaged fixtures and without permits, insurance or inspections.
",-1
"Government officials say about half of the housing in Puerto Rico was built illegally and without a permit, The Miami Herald reported Wednesday, which could amount to as many as 1 million homes.
",-1
"Puerto Rico's housing secretary, Fernando Gil, says the number of homes destroyed by the hurricane totals about 70,000 so far, and homes with major damage have amounted to 250,000 across the island.

"According to the National Weather Service, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico with winds up to 155 mph.
",-1
"Many buildings on the island were built under a prior code demanding protection against 125-mph winds.
",-1
"Furthermore, numerous homes have been built without any sort of permit at all.

",-1
"Our closest neighboring galaxy is also known as Messier 31 or M31.
",-1
"The name came from Charles Messier, the French astronomer who catalogued the large galaxy.
",-1
"Messier documented many objects in the skies of the Northern Hemisphere, and they are collectively known as the Messier objects or the Messier Catalog.
",-1
"(Note that Messier wasn’t always the first to observe the objects in his catalog.)
",-1
"In 1757, he had begun searching for Halley’s Comet, but the calculations given to him had sent him to a different section of the sky.
",-1
"That wrong section of the sky is where he observed a nebula that became the first entry in the catalog: M1, also known as the Crab Nebula.
",-1
"In 1764, Charles Messier added M31 to his catalog.
",-1
"By the end of the year, he had added a total of 38 objects.

"8 Larger Than The Milky Way
",-1
"In astronomy, a light-year is a commonly used unit to measure distance, but some astronomers prefer to use a unit called the parsec.
",-1
"When referring to something larger, they use kiloparsecs, which are equal to 1,000 parsecs, and megaparsecs, equal to one million parsecs.
",-1
"The Milky Way measures about 100,000 light-years or 30 kiloparsecs across.
",-1
"This may seem large, but it is rather small when compared to other galaxies.
",-1
"The Andromeda Galaxy has an approximate diameter of 220,000 light years, which is more than double of that of the Milky Way.
",-1
"It is the largest galaxy in the Local Cluster.
",-1
"If it were bright enough, the Andromeda Galaxy would appear larger than the Moon in the sky (as depicted above), even with it being much farther away.
",-1
"The galaxy is 9.5 trillion kilometers away from Earth, whereas the Moon is only 384,400 kilometers (238,900 mi) away—that should give you a better understanding of just how big the galaxy really is.

"Solar Storm Will Strike Earth Tonight, ‘Weak Power Grid Fluctuations’ Possible
",-1
"The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center forecasts an aurora could light up the sky above areas in the United State including Michigan and Maine.
",-1
"A solar storm, which occurred Monday, is expected to strike Earth tonight.
",-1
"On Monday, the sun spit out a slew of charged particles in a moderate solar flare.
",-1
"These particles are now making their way towards Earth.
",-1
"The planet’s magnetic field will block most of the particles, but some will make it into Earth’s atmosphere.
",-1
"The particles collect at the north and south poles and interact with atmospheric gases to create the aurora borealis or the Northern Lights.
",-1
"And some say this show could be quite spectacular.
",-1
"Solar flares have been known to cause power grid failures, but it looks like we’ll only get the light show this time.
",-1
"Although a grid failure is possible, it is unlikely.
",-1
"According to Seeker, the forecast calls for a high probability of a G-1 or “minor” storm, which could strengthen to a G-2 or “moderate” storm depending on how the stream of particles hit the Earth.
",-1
"Geomagnetic storms are ranked on a scale, with G at the bottom, R in the middle, and S as the most severe.
",-1
"Forecasts now say the particles will give our planet a glancing blow.
",-1
"Although this storm has been categorized as “G-1,” which means it is minor, it could still cause some havoc down on Earth.
",-1
"Solar flares and particle ejections are associated with sunspots — dark areas on the sun’s surface — that host intense magnetic activity.
",-1
"As the magnetic fields in a sunspot cross, NASA stated, this can cause a sudden energy explosion, also known as a solar flare.
",-1
"This sends radiation out into space, and that radiation can be hurled toward the Earth.
",-1
"G1-level storms, such as Monday’s, may affect migratory animals, and can cause “weak power grid fluctuations.” The barrage of particles may even have a minor impact on satellites.
",-1
"But it doesn’t look like there will be any serious damage to the power grid because of this storm as of right now.
",-1
"A colossal Neptunian storm just vanished before our eyes
",-1
"You don’t have to look far for fresh news about Mars, Saturn, or Jupiter these days, but Neptune doesn’t always get the same kind of attention.
",-1
"The big frigid blue ball is the farthest planet from the Sun — since we don’t count Pluto as a planet anymore — and it hasn’t been studied with the same intensity of many of the others.
",-1
"Thankfully the Hubble Space Telescope hasn’t lost interest in the distant planet, because it just captured one of Neptunes massive storms losing steam as it roars across the planet.
",-1
"Storms on Neptune appear as giant dark ovals, a bit like Jupiter’s Great Red Spot.
",-1
"However, unlike Jupiter’s centuries-old storm, Neptune’s hurricane-like weather events only last a few years at a time before eventually dissipating.
",-1
"The planet, which NASA says is the windiest in our Solar System, hosts regular storms which appear as large spots on its surface, but scientists are still at a loss as to how they actually occur.
",-1
"“We have no evidence of how these vortices are formed or how fast they rotate,” Agustín Sánchez-Lavega of the University of the Basque Country in Spain explains.
",-1
"“It is most likely that they arise from an instability in the sheared eastward and westward winds.”
",-1
"The observation of this particular storm dying out is significant because it’s the very first time one of Neptune’s storms has been observed in such a way.
",-1
"It also goes against everything that scientists thought they knew about how forms on Neptune live and die.
",-1
"“It looks like we’re capturing the demise of this dark vortex, and it’s different from what well-known studies led us to expect,” said Michael H. Wong of the University of California at Berkeley says.
",-1
"“Their dynamical simulations said that anticyclones under Neptune’s wind shear would probably drift toward the equator.
",-1
"We thought that once the vortex got too close to the equator, it would break up and perhaps create a spectacular outburst of cloud activity.”
",-1
"But this storm stayed its course, dying out in a horizontal path that didn’t bring it towards the Neptunian equator at all, forcing scientists to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new theory on the planet’s weather habits.

"Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia
",-1
"NewsCatholic Church, Homosexuality
",-1
"AUSTRIA, February 16, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – The Diocese of Linz, Austria, invited homosexual couples to participate in the blessing of couples on St. Valentine's Day.
",-1
"The move comes in the wake of the recent debate over the German bishops' initiative to bless homosexual couples, as well as the controversy over Bishop Andreas Laun's own criticism of it.
",-1
"The diocese’s own media report makes a reference to Amoris Laetitia, as well as to Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent initiative.
",-1
"The official diocesan newspaper, KirchenZeitung, announced on February 9 that in two different parishes in the Diocese of Linz homosexual couples were explicitly invited to receive a Church blessing on St. Valentine's Day.
",-1
"As is explained in the article:
",-1
"St. Valentine is known as the saint of friendship and of love.
",-1
"In many parishes and ecclesial institutions, it is already tradition to offer blessings of couples around the time of his feast day.
",-1
"People in homosexual relationships are welcome at the blessing ceremonies in Wels-St. Franziskus [Church] and in the Ursulinenkirche.
",-1
"Paul Stütz, the author of the article, explains that the blessing of couples “offers an occasion to express love.”
",-1
"“The blessing expresses that one is welcomed by one's partner and by God.” At the end of his article, he adds a link to another report about Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent 3 February interview showing his openness to the idea of blessings of homosexual couples in individual cases as decided by a pastor.
",-1
"Stütz also quotes in the article itself Father Franz Harant, “a pastoral worker in the field of marriage and the family” at the Ursulinenkirche in Linz.
",-1
"Harant himself shows himself a supporter of blessings for homosexual couples, and he makes here an explicit reference to Amoris Laetitia.
",-1
"As Stütz reports:
",-1
"We give out that universally available blessing.
",-1
"There, we have nothing to forbid,” says Harant.
",-1
"He sees himself in this in union with Pope Francis who himself says in his magisterial document Amoris Laetitia that “each person, independent of his sexual orientation, is to be respected in his dignity and welcomed with respect.
",-1
"As the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net writes, Harant must be quoting here AL 250.
",-1
"“We thus stress the high value of relationships,” explains Lehner.
",-1
"As the KirchenZeitung journalist adds: “This offer can be accepted by lovers in all kinds of life situations – also by lesbians and homosexuals.” Lehner, who is herself a theologian, regrets that, so far, no homosexual couple has come for the blessing.
",-1
"“Here with us, everybody should feel welcome, just as he or she is.” The pastoral assistant adds that “God is love.
",-1
"There are no restrictions.”
",-1
"The Diocesan Working Group on Pastoral Care for Homosexuals (dahop) is rejoicing about such a welcome from a parish.
",-1
"The group says that it repeatedly receives requests from homosexual couples who wish to “receive a blessing in the frame of a liturgy.”
",-1
"The KirchenZeitung then quotes a commentary, saying:
",-1
"It would be good if a clear sign of openness and invitation would be made by many more pastoral workers [male and female], in order to give the clear signal that love between two persons with equal rights are wished by God and thus already blessed.
",-1
"Moreover, the above-quoted Franz Harant himself is the contact person of this Diocesan Working Group – also called “Rainbow Pastoral.” As can be seen on the website of dahop, the Diocese of Linz offers special liturgical services for homosexuals, called “Queer Church Services” (Queer-Gottesdienste) that take place in Harant's own parish.
",-1
"It is not clear whether these church services take place in a form of a Holy Mass.
",-1
"Similar blessings for homosexual couples are currently taking place, or are being considered, also in Gemany, some of them on the diocesan level, some of them on an individual level.
",-1
"As LifeSiteNews reported in January, the Diocese of Limburg is publicly discussing the establishment of a special liturgical rite for the blessing of homosexuals.
",-1
"Publicly presented by Johannes zu Eltz, a high-ranking priest of the diocese, his so-called Frankfurt proposal has the public support of the local bishop, Georg Bätzing.
",-1
"Additionally, the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net reports that there are two Catholics priests in two different German dioceses who publicly state now to have given many blessings to homosexual couples.
",-1
"Father Christoph Simonsen (Diocese of Aachen) says that he has blessed 50 couples in the last fifteen years; Father Siegfried Modenbach (Archdiocese of Paderborn) has blessed two homosexual couples in the last years.
",-1
"He also conducts church services for homosexuals.
",-1
"Kath.net subsequently contacted both Dioceses and requested information about these two priests.
",-1
"As an answer, they were told that the Diocese intends to talk with the concerned priests, but that this matter needs to be addressed among the German bishops in general, such as in the German Bishops' Conference.
",-1
"This moral turmoil in German dioceses has provoked concern and criticism among Catholics.
",-1
"Mathias von Gersdorff, German pro-life activist and book author, states on his own blog, the upcoming Spring Assembly of the German Bishops' Conference will become crucial in this matter.
",-1
"As he sees it, “the bishops of Germany who will meet next week for the Spring Assembly of the Bishops' Conference find themselves in a complicated situation,” where they will have to show their colors.
",-1
"They will either be in favor of the Catholic Church's teaching on sexuality and marriage and forbid such blessings, or “essentially accept them,” at least by “saying nothing.”

"“The newly appointed members will add to the Commission’s global perspective in the protection of minors and vulnerable adults,” he said.
",-1
"“The Holy Father has ensured continuity in the work of our Commission, which is to assist local churches throughout the world in their efforts to safeguard all children, young people, and vulnerable adults from harm.”
",-1
"Local survivors of abuse greeted the announcement warily, hopeful that there could be positive change in the church but saying the panel accomplished little under its first three-year mandate.
",-1
"“The objectives of the commission when it was first announced, when it was just getting started.
",-1
"were never fulfilled,” said Phil Saviano, an abuse survivor who founded the New England chapter of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests.
",-1
"Saviano said the commission is “a good idea,” and added, “I’m not particularly optimistic that much will get accomplished, but a commission is better than no commission.”
",-1
"The pope said he had seen no proof of Barros’s guilt, but the Associated Press reported that O’Malley and other members of the commission had in 2015 hand-delivered to him an eight-page letter from a survivor that graphically detailed his abuse and said Barros and other clergy had witnessed him being fondled but had not intervened.
",-1
"Scanlan said his reaction to hearing that Francis has revived the commission was “hopeful but cynical.” Like Saviano, he said the panel accomplished little in its first incarnation.
",-1
"“My expectation is it will probably have the same outcome, because the church is the church, and they do it for appearance, but they’re still going to go by their own rules,” he said.
",-1
"Last month, O’Malley denounced the pope’s controversial defense of the Chilean bishop.
",-1
"Despite distancing himself from Pope Francis’s comments, O’Malley said that he has witnessed the pontiff’s genuine compassion for abuse victims.
",-1
"“The Pope’s statements that there is no place in the life of the Church for those who would abuse children and that we must adhere to zero tolerance for these crimes are genuine,” O’Malley said, “and they are his commitment.”

"Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections
",-1
"(Fixes dateline)
",-1
"* PM Orban faces elections on April 8, leads all polls
",-1
"* Migration has been Orban's defining theme since 2015
",-1
"* Says will counter globalism alongside U.S., UK, Israel
",-1
"By Marton Dunai
",-1
"BUDAPEST, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Hungarian leader Viktor Orban called on Sunday for a global alliance against migration as his right-wing populist Fidesz party began campaigning for an April 8 election in which it is expected to win a third consecutive landslide victory.
",-1
"Popular at home but increasingly at odds politically and economically with mainstream European Union peers, Orban has thrived on external controversy, including repeated clashes with Brussels and lately the United Nations.
",-1
"Orban is widely credited for reversing an economic slump in Hungary and controlling its public finances, culminating in a return to investment-grade for its debt, which was cut to 'junk' during the 2008 global economic crisis.
",-1
"To achieve that and hold onto power the prime minister, 54, has used methods that critics have called authoritarian, and picked fights with EU partners, especially in the West.
",-1
"Eastern leaders, most notably in Poland, have followed his lead.
",-1
"But migration dominates his agenda now.
",-1
"""Of course we will fight, and use ever stronger legal tools.
",-1
"Orban has for years targeted Hungarian-born U.S. financier George Soros, whose philanthropy aims to bolster liberal and open-border values -- anathema to Orban, an advocate of a loose group of strong nation states that reject multiculturalism.
",-1
"A defining moment of his premiership came in 2015, as the migrant crisis peaked: he built a double razor wire fence that became the symbol of anti-migrant sentiment in Europe.
",-1
"Orban also said the Hungarian opposition had failed to heed the call of history when it opposed his toughness on migrants.
",-1
"Voters have responded favourably and Orban is a clear leader of all polls.
",-1
"POWERFUL ALLIES
",-1
"Orban has conflated the issue of immigration with the image of Soros, 87, whose name was used in a tough anti-migrant bill sent to Parliament on Wednesday.
",-1
"Orban has tightened the screws on non-government organisations, particularly ones funded by Soros, and attempted to close a prominent Soros-founded university.
",-1
"Attributing to Soros a recent United Nations plan on creating a global blueprint to handle the migration crisis, Orban said he anticipated that powerful allies would help him prevent the U.N. from greasing the wheels of migration.
",-1
"""Soros has antagonised not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too,"" he said.
",-1
"""Everywhere he wants to get migration accepted.
",-1
"It won't work.
",-1
"We are not alone and we will fight together ... and we will succeed.""
",-1
"In Europe, he cited as allies Hungary's fellow Visegrad countries Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland, whose ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party is also often at loggerheads with the EU.
",-1
"He said a victory for Silvio Berlusconi's party in Italy's March 4 election would strengthen the nationalist fold.
",-1
"""We don't think the fight is hopeless, on the contrary, we are winning,"" Orban said.
",-1
"""The V4 is firm, Croatia has come around, Austria has turned in the patriotic direction, and in Bavaria the CSU has created a resistance.""

",-1
"Addressing his country and the world, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán warned that European nations which have encouraged migration have, “opened the way to the decline of Christian culture and the advance of Islam.”
",-1
"Orbán painted an image of Western Europe being overwhelmed by the accelerating influx Muslim immigrants in recent years.
",-1
"“According to estimates, the proportion of immigrants will grow at an accelerated pace in the European countries west of us,” said Orbán.
",-1
"“I won't even say anything about France and Holland, but even the born Germans are being forced back from most large German cities as migrants always occupy big cities first.”
",-1
"Prime Minister Orbán said his government will oppose efforts by the United Nations or the European Union to “increase migration” around the world.
",-1
"In June, LifeSiteNews reported that Orbán had taken a strong stand and not backed down against outside globalist influences seeking to control his nation’s politics.
",-1
"Orbán and Soros have a history, beginning in partnership and ending in acrimony.
",-1
"Orbán started public life as a crusader against communism and attended Oxford University on a Soros scholarship.
",-1
"Soros, who expatriated from Hungary, also funded Orbán’s political organization, the Alliance for Young Democrats.
",-1
"The Daily Mail report continued:
",-1
"But Orbán remains committed to his policy, claiming that Soros and supporters of migration are losing the fight.
",-1
"He said: “Soros has antagonised not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too.
",-1
"Everywhere he wants to get migration accepted.
",-1
"We are not alone and we will fight together and we will succeed.”
",-1
"In addition to inviting Soros’ ire, Orbán came under fire a couple years ago from the U.S. State Department under President Obama as well as the European Parliament for purportedly discriminating against homosexuals because of Hungary’s insistence on defining marriage between a man and a woman, and that pre-born babies have rights.
",-1
"Last year, Orbán also criticized liberals and encouraged citizens to give life to more children during the 11th conference of the World Congress of Families.
",-1
"Three thousand “natural family” advocates who attended the four-day conference heard Orbán in his opening address lambaste the European Union (EU) for its “relativizing liberal ideology that’s an insult to families.”

"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban Calls For Global Anti-Migrant Alliance

"Viktor Orban, who openly professes the Reformed faith of Christianity, told an audience at the Royal Castle in Budapest, “Christianity is Europe’s last hope.”

"He continued by stating that mass immigration, especially from Africa, “our worst nightmares can come true.
",-1
"The West falls as it fails to see Europe being overrun.”

"Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot
",-1
"Last week Pope Francis announced he was reviving a panel he created to advise the Vatican on how to handle sexual abuse by clergy.
",-1
"The issue has dogged the Roman Catholic Church in recent years, and critics have accused Francis and his two predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, of failing to aggressively weed out and punish predator priests.
",-1
"Here’s a look what drove the panel’s creation and what to expect in the future.
",-1
"What is Pope Francis’ commission on sexual abuse?
",-1
"Following criticism he was not focusing on halting child abuse within the church, Francis created the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors in March 2014, naming Cardinal Sean O’Malley, the archbishop of Boston, to run it.
",-1
"O’Malley was not only a member of the pope’s “G9” group of close advisors; he was also the man who sought to clean up the abuse scandal in Boston after the departure of his predecessor, Cardinal Bernard Law, whose shifting of predator priests to new posts was exposed by the Boston Globe and chronicled in the movie “Spotlight.”
",-1
"The revelations about Law, who died in December, emboldened abuse victims across the country and world, who began speaking up about the priests who had molested them.
",-1
"When he created the commission, Francis said: “The commission’s specific task is to propose to me the most opportune initiatives for protecting minors and vulnerable adults, in order that we may do everything possible to ensure that crimes such as those which have occurred are no longer repeated in the Church.”
",-1
"Why is it being renewed now?
",-1
"After the commission’s three-year mandate expired in December, Francis relaunched it on Feb. 17 with some members reappointed and nine new members added, some of whom are victims of abuse, although the Vatican declined to say which, opting to respect their privacy.
",-1
"O’Malley returns as chief.
",-1
"New members come from Australia, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, the Netherlands and Tonga, ""reflecting the global reach of the church and the challenge of creating safeguarding structures in diverse cultural context,” the Vatican said.
",-1
"What did the first commission achieve?
",-1
"The Vatican has said it “worked with almost 200 dioceses and religious communities worldwide to raise awareness and to educate people on the need for safeguarding in our homes, parishes, schools, hospitals, and other institutions.”
",-1
"What didn’t it do?
",-1
"Commission members quickly realized they needed to go beyond raising awareness and deal with the bishops who quietly shift offenders to new dioceses when they are exposed as molesters and rapists.
",-1
"Even if church laws already existed to hold bishops accountable for their priests’ behavior, those strictures were not enough, O’Malley said in 2014.
",-1
"“There are, theoretically I guess, canons that could apply here, but obviously they have not been sufficient,” he said.
",-1
"But amid myriad legal questions over what exact powers the court would have, it never got off the ground.
",-1
"In 2016, Francis officially killed the plan to create it, issuing a document that essentially called on using existing procedures to tackle the problem.
",-1
"Francis was also criticized when Australian Cardinal George Pell, whom he had brought to Rome to clean up Vatican finances, was forced to return to Australia last year to face charges of sexual assault.
",-1
"Any other problems?
",-1
"But this simple message was hard to get across.
",-1
"It emerged that during a Vatican training course for new bishops in September 2015 a French priest informed bishops they had no obligation to report abuse to the police, forcing the commission to issue a strong statement saying bishops had every obligation to do so.
",-1
"Did commission members persevere?
",-1
"Not all of them.
",-1
"British member Peter Saunders, a former victim of priestly abuse, was ousted in 2016.
",-1
"He said the group was a toothless, paper-shuffling exercise.
",-1
"Irish member Marie Collins, another victim, resigned in March last year and said Vatican bureaucrats had refused to comply with the commission’s request — approved by the pope — to respond to all letters sent to the Vatican by abuse victims.
",-1
"Marie Collins, then a member of the pope's sex abuse commission, in 2015 hands a letter to Cardinal Sean O'Malley detailing the abuse suffered by Juan Carlos Cruz of Chile.
",-1
"Catherine Bonnet / Associated Press
",-1
"Was the pope listening to the commission?
",-1
"Possibly not.
",-1
"In 2015, Collins handed O’Malley a letter addressed to the pope from Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean abused as a boy by Chilean prelate Fernando Karadima, who was sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of penance in 2010.
",-1
"Cruz described how the abuse was witnessed and covered up by Juan Barros, a priest whose appointment as a bishop in 2015 prompted huge protests in Chile.
",-1
"""I can't condemn [Barros] because I don't have evidence,"" he said on the plane back to Rome, suggesting he had ignored or never read the letter from Cruz.
",-1
"That was too much for O’Malley, who said Francis had caused ""great pain” to victims.
",-1
"Vatican watchers believe the pope was influenced by Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errazuriz, a member of the G9 group who has backed Barros and reportedly helped block moves to make Cruz a member of the abuse commission.
",-1
"So is the pope intransigent on Barros?
",-1
"Something changed his mind after his Chilean trip, possibly the scale of the protest against Barros in the country.
",-1
"On Feb. 17, he sent a senior Vatican sex abuse investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to New York to interview Cruz, who now lives in Philadelphia.
",-1
"""For the first time I felt that someone is listening,"" Cruz said after the meeting.
",-1
"What happens next?
",-1
"“This should lead to Barros stepping down,” said Saunders, who is forming his own campaign group with Cruz and others to fight clerical abuse.
",-1
"The new papal commission will meanwhile hold its first meeting in April.

"Of the 145 arrested, 86 had criminal convictions; 39 were arrested based on previous immigration encounters, four of which have pending criminal charges; 20 had no prior immigration history or encounters, one has pending criminal charges.
",-1
"Of the total arrests 135 were men and 10 were women.
",-1
"They range in age from 18 to 62 years old.
",-1
"Aliens arrested during this operation are from the following countries: Mexico (128), Guatemala (7), El Salvador (1), Honduras (7), Peru (1) and Jordan (1).

"DOJ May Hit #Resistance Mayor Who Warned Illegal Criminals w/Obstruction of Justice
",-1
"Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, slammed Mayor Schaaf, who on Saturday night released an unprecedented warning that ICE was about to begin arresting people.
",-1
"Schaaf said she issued the alert after receiving confidential tips from “credible sources,” and conferring with attorneys to make sure she wasn’t opening herself up to federal prosecution.
",-1
"Now the DOJ is looking into Schaaf.
",-1
"The Department of Justice is looking into whether Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf obstructed justice by warning Northern California residents of an impending raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
",-1
"The agency’s acting director, Thomas Homan, told “Fox & Friends” Wednesday morning that the DOJ is “reviewing” whether Schaaf broke any laws by telling her constituents ICE would be raiding the area in order to arrest people violating federal immigration laws.

"One such fugitive is a documented gang member whose “accumulated criminal convictions in California... have resulted in more than 15 years of prison sentencings” and who had previously been removed by ICE four times.

"Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan
",-1
"The media has maintained a tight embargo on the release of the photo of Obama meeting with Nation of Islam hate group leader Louis Farrakhan at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting.
",-1
"Almost no national media outlet has covered the story.
",-1
"CNN only mentioned it when it embedded Jake Tapper's tweets about the support for Farrakhan by Women's March leaders.
",-1
"But Rep. Danny Davis had defended Farrakhan.
",-1
"An ADL official told JTA on Friday that the group had reached out to Rep. Danny Davis, a Democrat, after an article in The Daily Caller said he lauded Farrakhan on Monday as “an outstanding human being.” Farrakhan has calledJews “the enemy of God and the enemy of the righteous,” and said Jews were responsible for the 9/11 terror attacks and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the 20th century.
",-1
"“He expressed an interest in seeing some of the latest statements made by Farrakhan vis-a-vis Jews, which we promptly shared with him.” The official said the ADL had shared information with Davis about Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic statements, and that the organization was waiting to hear back from him.
",-1
"“I think that was what they wanted to write.
",-1
"Nah, I don’t have no problems with Farrakhan, I don’t spend a whole lot of my time dealing with those kind of things,” Davis said.
",-1
"“That’s just one segment of what goes on in our world.
",-1
"For those heavy into it, that’s their thing, but it ain’t my thing,” he said
",-1
"Somehow I don't think a white congressman would get away with saying that he agrees with David Duke on the environment but isn't especially concerned about his racism.
",-1
"But black leaders have gotten away with playing that game with Farrakhan repeatedly.
",-1
"And if they can't whitewash this, they'll ignore it.

",-1
"Of those 232, 180 “were either convicted criminals, had been issued a final order of removal and failed to depart the United States, or had been previously removed” from the country and had come back illegally.

"The arrests included 115 who ""had prior felony convictions for serious or violent offenses, such as child sex crimes, weapons charges and assault, or had past convictions for significant or multiple misdemeanors.""
",-1
"The numbers might have been greater, but for the intervention of Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who tweeted out a warning of the impending raid, tipping off others who might have been caught...
",-1
"""I did what I believe was right for my community as well as to protect public safety,"" Schaaf said Friday, according to NBC Bay Area.

",-1
"This report is from Seattle:Doubtless, many other states are also considering passing “red flag” laws.
",-1
"“The city’s police department became the first law enforcement agency in the state to force the surrender of a firearm under a new law known as an ‘extreme risk protection order.’
",-1
"“The incident involves a man who lives in Belltown, who neighbors said had been intimidating people for the past year – even staring-down customers through store-front windows with a gun holstered at his side.
",-1
"“Mental illness is suspected, but that new law allowed police to legally disarm him.”
",-1
"“The man, who we are not naming, is also well known to the bars and restaurants below his unit along Second Ave.
",-1
"The volume of complaints convinced Seattle police to seek an extreme risk protection order – or ‘erpo’ – which allows law enforcement to legally remove guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.
",-1
"“In this case, the man refused to comply.
",-1
"Because of the new law, police were then able to return with a warrant and force the man to surrender the firearm.”
",-1
"“A few dozen erpos have been served and executed around the state, but Seattle police said they are the only agency so far to seize a gun because the owner refused to hand it over.
",-1
"“Law enforcement professionals said these specialized protection orders could be a common sense strategy to try and prevent mass shootings – such as what happened in Parkland, Florida.
",-1
"“‘There’s certainly a big concern of the connection between mental health and people exhibiting violent behavior and whether or not they should have access to firearms.
",-1
"The “erpos” give us that tool now as an option,’ said Sgt.
",-1
"Eric Pisconski, who leads the crisis response unit for the Seattle Police Department.
",-1
"“The confiscations only last a year, although they can be renewed.”
",-1
"See the report here:
",-1
"Seattle Police First In State To Seize Gun Under Mental Health Law
",-1
"A few observations are in order here:
",-1
"First, the open carry of a firearm is LEGAL in the area where this took place.
",-1
"So, the fellow was violating NO gun laws whatsoever.
",-1
"Plus, he never removed the pistol from its holster or brandished it in any way.
",-1
"Secondly, the man was “known” to nearby bars and restaurants near his place of residence.
",-1
"That means nothing.
",-1
"Known for what?
",-1
"The report doesn’t even say the man was known for acting weirdly or strangely.
",-1
"Thirdly, what does “volume of complaints” mean?
",-1
"How many complaints were received over a YEAR’S time?
",-1
"Two?
",-1
"Five?
",-1
"Ten?
",-1
"People complaining about other people happens all of the time.
",-1
"Plus, if complaints had been received over the course of an entire year and police just now decided to act, the man must not have been considered much of a threat.
",-1
"The report says “he had been intimidating people.” How?
",-1
"No specifics except to say he was “staring” at people.
",-1
"Wow!
",-1
"Run for your lives!
",-1
"Fifthly, a U.S. citizen who has committed NO CRIME is denied his Natural right of self-defense for a whole year.
",-1
"And the media report says the confiscations “only” last a year, with the caveat that they may be extended.
",-1
"Indeed.
",-1
"They could and very likely will be extended indefinitely.
",-1
"It seems many politicians (and many police officers themselves) will not be content until every American citizen is totally defenseless and unable to protect him or herself.
",-1
"Sixthly, the man quoted in the news story who had complained about the armed fellow did so because he said he didn’t like the sight of the man carrying a firearm, as it made him “afraid.”
",-1
"That the mere sight of a law-abiding citizen openly carrying a sidearm would make someone “afraid” is not sufficient reason to deny the citizen his constitutional right to keep and “bear” arms.
",-1
"Even when police forced the man to surrender his firearm, the man made no threatening gesture toward the officers.
",-1
"I go into the “mental health” trap in more detail in this column:
",-1
"Trump Set To Enact More Gun Control
",-1
"“Mental health” regulations for gun ownership is what extremist gun grabbers Schumer, Pelosi, Feinstein, et al., have been trying to accomplish for decades.
",-1
"Now, it is the “pro-gun” Republican President Donald Trump who is the one making it happen.
",-1
"Kris Kobach is the Secretary of State of Kansas.
",-1
"He is a former professor of constitutional law at UMKC Law School.
",-1
"He wrote an excellent analysis of the constitutional violations of these “red flag” laws:
",-1
"The seizure of guns without any hearing at all.
",-1
"The laws all contain an “ex parte” provision that allows the state to temporarily seize a person’s guns without even notifying the gun owner or giving him a chance to be heard.
",-1
"This is the quintessential denial of due process.
",-1
"The Fourth Amendment makes clear that a person cannot be denied of liberty (to exercise one’s constitutional right to bear arms) without due process of law.
",-1
"This confiscation is “temporary,” but it can easily lead to long-term or permanent confiscation.
",-1
"Based on the testimony of one unrelated person.
",-1
"The confiscation order can be based on the testimony of only one person claiming that the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others.
",-1
"But “family member” is defined to include “former dating partners” and anyone who has ever lived with the defendant.
",-1
"So a jilted former boyfriend or girlfriend, or even a roommate from years ago, could easily set in motion the disarming of a lawful gun owner.
",-1
"Using a very low standard of proof.
",-1
"That’s even lower than the “probable cause” standard for obtaining a search warrant.
",-1
"In addition, the judge is forced to rush his decision and issue the confiscation order on the same day of the ex parte hearing.
",-1
"Within two weeks of the ex parte hearing, a hearing with the gun owner present must occur; the purpose is to put in place a long-term confiscation order.
",-1
"But even at that hearing, the standard of proof is far below the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used in criminal trials.
",-1
"Rather, it need only be shown by “a preponderance of evidence” that the person poses a risk of injury to self or others.
",-1
"What kind of evidence?
",-1
"Things like the “reckless storage” of firearms and drinking habits can be considered.
",-1
"Shifting the burden of proof to the gun owner.
",-1
"The long-term confiscation order lasts up to a year, but may be renewed indefinitely.
",-1
"Once it is in place, it becomes very difficult to remove.
",-1
"To have the confiscation order lifted, the gun owner must provehe does not pose a threat to himself or others.
",-1
"Freedomists in the 50 states had better keep a close eye on their State legislatures this year and next, because, thanks to Donald Trump, gun confiscation is going to be on the agenda in virtually every single State in the country.
",-1
"And while you are at it, don’t overlook the federal Congress.

"One more time I want to remind readers that self-defense—including defense against tyrannical government—is more than a right guaranteed in the Second Amendment to our Constitution; it is a duty assigned us in Nature by our Creator.

"For anyone, especially a Christian, to willingly surrender their means of self-defense is not only a crime against liberty; it is a sin against God.

"I urge my Christian friends (and anyone else) to read the book my constitutional attorney son and I wrote entitled “To Keep or Not To Keep: Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns.”

"Some credit also goes to Jake Tapper at CNN and Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post for a willingness to discuss the subject even when their media outlets didn't want to.

"(Some Final Thoughts on Joseph Ratzinger)
",-1
"Recently an editor of a “conservative” Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, five years on.
",-1
"I declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies.
",-1
"It’s been five years, and I’ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a “courageous” act it was to give up the pontificate.
",-1
"Editor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr.
",-1
"Our thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below.
",-1
"Why would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed?
",-1
"We cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before.
",-1
"Of all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously.
",-1
"How content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life.
",-1
"So strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind.
",-1
"But this is not what we see.
",-1
"There he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud.
",-1
"“Perhaps it was written for him.” Well, why repeat it then?
",-1
"Why, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda?
",-1
"If it is a deception, why participate in it?
",-1
"In fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they “miss” him have failed to respect him in one way; they won’t take him at his word.
",-1
"Some insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn’t valid.
",-1
"But we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely.
",-1
"We have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat.
",-1
"There’s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn’t add up, it’s true.
",-1
"Why did you resign?
",-1
"Ratzinger: “I was a bit tired and didn’t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.”
",-1
"If you’re not pope, why do you still wear the white?
",-1
"Ratzinger: “Oh, there wasn’t a black cassock that fit me.”
",-1
"Why do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope?
",-1
"Ratzinger: “Well, I’m an ‘emeritus,’ you see…”
",-1
"And where did this “emeritus” business come from?
",-1
"Does it have any precedent in Catholic history?
",-1
"What does it mean canonically and doctrinally?
",-1
"Ratzinger: “…”
",-1
"Doesn’t that just mean there are two popes now?
",-1
"A few days ago, my friend Steve Skojec, of the traditionalist/restorationist website One Peter Five, summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for (the man we used to call) Pope Benedict.
",-1
"Five years ago today, Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy.
",-1
"And through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time – one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word, deed, or even the subtlest gesture.
",-1
"You may love him for various reasons, you may miss him by contrast, but you may not excuse the responsibility he has.
",-1
"And still, he was the best of the post-conciliar popes, which is why he’s the only one who won’t be canonized.
",-1
"Who is the real Joseph Ratzinger?
",-1
"I have had long-time Vatican watchers say to me, more than once, “Maybe it’s really just that he wasn’t who we thought he was.” I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine.
",-1
"I think we made the mistake of believing the press.
",-1
"We failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism.
",-1
"This reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus, the theological advisor, of one of the Council’s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne.
",-1
"Frings’ claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF – and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani – for the “conservatism” in the “schema,” the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops’ discussions.
",-1
"After this speech, there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema – that had taken years to develop – be abandoned.
",-1
"Cardinal Henri de Lubac, writing in 1985, recalling that drama, said:
",-1
"“Joseph Ratzinger, an expert at the Council, was also the private secretary of Card.
",-1
"Frings, Archbishop of Cologne.
",-1
"Blind, the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions.
",-1
"Now then, one of these interventions became memorable: it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office.
",-1
"Despite a reply by Card.
",-1
"Ottaviani, Frings sustained his critique.
",-1
"“It is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office, as it presented itself then, was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop.
",-1
"“Card.
",-1
"Ratzinger, who did not change, continues it.”
",-1
"It went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF, that he had written in 1982, a call for the Church “never to return” to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX.
",-1
"In his book Principles of Catholic Theology, Ratzinger proposed the question, “Should the Council be revoked?” and in response recommended the “razing of the bastions” of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world:
",-1
"The duty is, therefore, not to suppress the Council, but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then.
",-1
"This implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus, which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism, but which cannot be the last word.
",-1
"Neither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [relations with] the modern world for the Christian.
",-1
"Hence, the 'razing of the bastions' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty.
",-1
"It was necessary for her [the Church] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith, the power of the word that is her unique, true, and permanent strength.
",-1
"But to raze the bastions cannot signify that she no longer has anything to protect, or that she can live owing to different forces than those that engendered her: the water and the blood that poured from the open side of her crucified Lord.
",-1
"His was the thesis – a mainstay of “conservative” ideology – that the “real” Council, if only implemented properly, would be the salvation of the Church and the world, a theme he never left.
",-1
"And it starts to suggest an answer, or at least a line of inquiry, about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure.
",-1
"Kung, who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy?
",-1
"Can we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree?
",-1
"Precious few.
",-1
"Why did we think that Ratzinger, in this crucial role of CDF prefect, was a bulwark of orthodoxy?
",-1
"Is it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison, to make an objective judgement?
",-1
"Indeed, Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions.
",-1
"He was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological “left” after the 1960s while he stayed in place.
",-1
"Perhaps now, as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces, we can finally accept his word on this.
",-1
"Is this why he resigned?
",-1
"Is it simply that his conception of the Church, of the papacy, was never what Catholics believed about it?
",-1
"Fausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops’ palace of Milan in June 2012.
",-1
"Martini, Fausti said, urged Benedict to resign the papacy.
",-1
"Apparently at the time of his election in 2005, Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia.
",-1
"By 2012, this had proved impossible.
",-1
"I think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger.
",-1
"They were esteemed academic colleagues.
",-1
"They were brothers of the episcopate.
",-1
"They were members of the club.
",-1
"Any appearance of ideological division between them was, in essence, a product of the media narrative.
",-1
"Why wouldn’t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal?
",-1
"Why is Walter Kasper a cardinal?
",-1
"When, at his very first Angelus address in 2013, Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper, quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope.
",-1
"In an article on the cardinal’s life’s work, Thomas Jansen, the editor-in-chief of Katholisch.de, recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict.
",-1
"The monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper’s work as Bergoglio’s.
",-1
"This is a man who has, for 40 years, never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome.
",-1
"This was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF.
",-1
"Why was he not – at the very least – given the same “silencing” treatment as Kung?
",-1
"Kasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic.
",-1
"After openly working against the Faith, instead of being demoted, silenced, laicised and/or excommunicated, John Paul II made him a cardinal.
",-1
"Remember that his scheme to Amoris-Latitia-ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger’s CDF in 1993.
",-1
"But he was not demoted, reprimanded or corrected in any way.
",-1
"Nor was he removed from places of influence.
",-1
"Far from it.
",-1
"In 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.
",-1
"In 1999, he made another step up, being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the “ecumenical” office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign.
",-1
"Then Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal.
",-1
"As Jansen pointed out, and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five,
",-1
"Cardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave, because he had just turned 80 years of age.
",-1
"But since the date of the death (or abdication, as it was the case in 2013) of the pope is decisive, he was still able to attend and vote in that election.
",-1
"(As some observers noted, it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time.)
",-1
"Excuse me Maike, but I don’t think this is a parenthetical issue.
",-1
"Why is he still a bishop?
",-1
"Why is he still allowed to call himself a “Catholic theologian”?
",-1
"Why did you, apparently deliberately, ensure that he was able to enter the Conclave to decide who your successor was going to be?
",-1
"Doesn’t anyone else want to know this?
",-1
"Don’t we all want to know why Hans Kung is still a priest?
",-1
"Why was Cardinal Mahony allowed to retire in good standing?
",-1
"What are the names we all remember, just off the top of our heads?
",-1
"My own bishop in Victoria, the occultist Remi de Roo, Seattle’s Raymond Hunthausen, Miami’s Favalora, Rochester’s Matthew Clark, Derek Worlock of Liverpool… I sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over.

"The end of “Big Umbrella Catholicism”
",-1
"The New York Times’ Ross Douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions.
",-1
"There’s a “liberal wing” and a “conservative wing” and they’re both Catholic.
",-1
"By playing along, by pretending that we could be “conservative Catholics” in this New Paradigm that also includes “liberal Catholics” we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history.
",-1
"It created cover for the men of Kasper’s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of Peter five years ago.
",-1
"And just like that, the jargon of “tolerance” and the “big umbrella” is over and the purge of faithful, believing Catholic religious, seminarians, priests, and academics has begun.
",-1
"As it had to.
",-1
"They, at least, do not harbour this insane contradiction, and understand – and frequently say out loud – that the New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same.
",-1
"And their New Church is the only one left.
",-1
"We had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed, while the institution around them fell to the New Paradigm, until the papacy was the only thing left.
",-1
"One of the things I’ve been saying is a blessing in disguise, and an enormous relief, about the Bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the Wojtyla/Ratzinger era.
",-1
"For those still wondering, Bergoglio isn’t a shock, he isn’t even a surprise; he’s just the logical end result.
",-1
"This pontificate isn’t an anomaly; it was the only possible outcome, and it was as much the work of Joseph Ratzinger as Walter Kasper.

"Did Oakland Mayor Tip Off La Raza to ICE Raid?
",-1
"Schaaf refuses to say how she learned about the ICE raids, only saying it was not from official sources.
",-1
"“I felt that it was my duty to share the information,” Schaaf said.
",-1
"In emails we obtained through a public records request, we didn’t find out who her sources were, but we do know who she was talking to before she made her big announcement.
",-1
"Emails reveal that hours before the announcement, a group called Centro Legal de la Raza sent the mayor information on what employers should do in case of an ICE raid.
",-1
"Hours before the public was warned about ICE raids, some Oakland businesses got a head start, thanks to the mayor.
",-1
"According to emails, the Oakland Indie Alliance, a group of independent businesses, got a message saying “Important Alert!
",-1
"Credible information ICE Raids in Oakland Sunday 2/25 and Monday 2/26” and “This information comes directly from the Mayor.”
",-1
"Now that last part is significant.
",-1
"Any business that tips off illegal aliens admits that it is aware of their status.
",-1
"By passing along the warning, Mayor Schaaf was tipping off criminals committing a felony.

"MS-503 Gang Member Apprehended by Border Patrol Agents In Arizona
",-1
"YUMA, Ariz. – Yuma Sector Border Patrol agents arrested a gang member belonging to the Mara Salvatrucha-503 Gang early Monday morning.
",-1
"At 6:30 a.m. Monday, Yuma Station agents responded to a call for assistance at Carver Park from the Yuma Police Department.
",-1
"After agents interviewed the subject, it was determined that the 20-year-old El Salvadoran national was illegally in the United States.
",-1
"He was arrested and transported to Yuma Station.
",-1
"Agents positively identified the subject as Jose Rodriguez-Lopez and noted a MS-503 Gang tattoo across his chest.
",-1
"Rodriguez-Lopez had no record of any criminal or immigration arrests in the United States.
",-1
"He was processed for immigration violations.

"Rep. Danny Davis was For/Against/For/Against Farrakhan
",-1
"Rep. Danny Davis helped get the ball rolling by praising Farrakhan.
",-1
"Then Rep. Davis' office issued a statement disavowing Farrakhan.
",-1
"And then Davis got right back to talking to the Daily Caller and disavowed the disavowal.
",-1
"“The congressman was insistent that The Daily Caller misquoted him during the interview and that he didn’t subscribe to Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic statements and actions in the past,” the ADL official told JTA in a statement.
",-1
"“He expressed an interest in seeing some of the latest statements made by Farrakhan vis-a-vis Jews, which we promptly shared with him.” The congressman wasn’t sure why the ADL wrote that he had been misquoted in his praise for the anti-Semite, and said he wasn’t sure if someone from his office had told the ADL he was misquoted, he told The Daily Caller News Foundation on Sunday.
",-1
"The term ""Jewish Question"" is largely used by anti-Semites.
",-1
"So Davis then sorta disavowed his own statements.
",-1
"J Street endorsed him.
",-1
"And then he talked to the Daily Caller again.

",-1
"I wonder how far a white congressman would get saying, ""I attended the Klavern, but I don't agree with the KKK's views about black people.""
",-1
"But that's Rep. Davis' current views.
",-1
"He likes a racist hate group.
",-1
"Whoever the JTA has on the ""explain away Farrakhan's Dem fandom"" beat is going to be busy again.
",-1
"And J Street is on record as endorsing a politician who praised a racist hate group leader and discussed the ""Jewish question.""

"Three illegal immigrants, who avoided capture after Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf blew the whistle on a raid by federal immigration authorities last month, have since been re-arrested for new crimes including robbery and spousal abuse, ICE officials said.

",-1
"“How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of our law enforcement officers to promote a radical, open borders agenda.”

"But on Tuesday, officials said that at least three of those who were targeted in the raid, but were not apprehended, had since been arrested for additional crimes.

"Travis Air Force Base terrorist identified as Muslim Hafiz Kazi
",-1
"Earlier today I wrote: “FBI spokeswoman Gina Swankie and Travis spokesman Airman Christian Conrad declined to elaborate on the matter or identify the driver.
",-1
"Why?”
",-1
"Now it’s clear why.
",-1
"“Man whose vehicle exploded at Travis AFB identified,” KGO, March 23, 2018:
",-1
"TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (KGO) — A man who drove into Travis AFB has been identified as 51-year-old Hafiz Kazi, two sources with knowledge of the probe tell ABC News.
",-1
"Authorities extracted a video from his cell phone and are analyzing it to try and see if it could help point to a motive.
",-1
"Sources wouldn’t offer any details about the video.
",-1
"The FBI is holding a press conference Friday at 3:30 p.m. and will be asking the public for help and any information about Kazi.
",-1
"Sources say the information gathered so far still does not point to a concrete motive, with one source calling the man a “mystery” still.
",-1
"Terrorism, mental health issues, and everything else are still on the table as authorities try to uncover a motive.
",-1
"On Wednesday, the car crashed at the main gate of Travis Air Force Base.
",-1
"Officials are treating it as a possible attempted attack.
",-1
"The FBI is now leading the investigation.
",-1
"“The car basically blew up,” said witness Kamren Hernandez.
",-1
"Hernandez’ father, Lamar, saw it too.
",-1
"Kept on going.” Travis Air Force Base officials are investigating a security incident that occurred at the main gate on Wednesday….
",-1
"A U.S. official tells ABC News it appears the driver had propane tanks in the vehicle, which they may have ignited deliberately….
",-1
"“We don’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point,” Ragan said.
",-1
"That means they didn’t find an ISIS membership card in his wallet, or lots of phone calls to Iraq or Syria, or a note from Kazi reading, “I did this for Allah and Islam.
",-1
"In any case, a larger point is being lost here.
",-1
"And that is that there is a war going on.
",-1
"We know that Kazi, with all the propane and gas tanks in his car, was clearly trying to set off a major fire that would kill more people than just himself.
",-1
"Even if he wasn’t on the phone to Baghdadi, the likelihood is that when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad.
",-1
"The FBI’s bafflement here is part of its deep, deep corruption.
",-1
"The FBI doesn’t acknowledge that there is a global jihad, or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism.
",-1
"It doesn’t admit that there is a war going on, and treats each act of Islamic terror as if it were a separate and discrete criminal event, unrelated to all the others.
",-1
"So, each time something like this happens, they’re back at Square One, trying to figure out motive.
",-1
"“Motive a mystery in car explosion at Travis Air Force Base,” by Phil Willon, Los Angeles Times, March 23, 2018:
",-1
"Federal investigators on Friday said that the person who drove a burning minivan filled with propane and gas tanks into the front gate of Travis Air Force Base in Northern California was a 51-year-old Bay Area man originally from India.
",-1
"Hafiz Kazi was a legal permanent resident and had lived in the United States since 1993, said Sean Ragan, FBI special agent in charge of the Sacramento field office.
",-1
"Kazi had lived in the Bay Area, including Sausalito, Ragan said, but his most recent place of residence was not known.
",-1
"Investigators have yet to determine a motive for the Wednesday night attack or evidence that anyone else was involved.
",-1
"“We don’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point,” Ragan said, adding that aspect of the case was still being investigated.
",-1
"“Now the question is, why.
",-1
"Why was he there?
",-1
"What led him there?
",-1
"And we don’t know answers to that, quite frankly.” Kazi drove the Kia minivan through the front gate of the military base, which is near Fairfield, around 7 p.m. Wednesday.
",-1
"Security personnel saw flames inside the van, which crashed shortly after going through the gate, Ragan said.
",-1
"Emergency responders initially did not know if it was an attack or some sort of mishap.
",-1
"But when they opened the doors to the minivan they found five propane tanks, three plastic one-gallon gas cans, several lighters, three phones and a gym bag with personal items, Ragan said….

"The dead man’s religious beliefs and affiliation are not known at this point, said Ragan, who debunked a rumor that some sort of “jihad” video was found on Kazi’s phone….

"Western Michigan ICE operation nets 16 arrests over 4-day period
",-1
"KALAMAZOO, Mich. – U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) deportation officers arrested 16 individuals for violating federal immigration laws in western Michigan during a four-day targeted enforcement operation that ended Thursday.
",-1
"Nine of the immigration violators arrested during the operation were convicted criminals.
",-1
"Two individuals illegally re-entered the country after deportation.
",-1
"Depending on the alien’s criminal history, an alien who illegally reenters the United States, after having been previously removed, has committed a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison.
",-1
"Fourteen men and two women were arrested during the enforcement actions.
",-1
"With the exception of a Congolese man, all of those arrested were nationals of Mexico.
",-1
"Enforcement activities took place primarily in Berrien, Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, and Van Buren counties.
",-1
"Criminal convictions of those arrested include but are not limited to domestic violence, DUI, operating while intoxicated, illegal entry, aggravated assault, assault and battery and carrying a concealed weapon.
",-1
"The arrests include:
",-1
"· A 19-year-old male Mexican national with a prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon.
",-1
"· A 46-year-old male national of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with convictions for aggravated assault, resisting arrest, and other charges.
",-1
"· A 36-year-old male Mexican national with convictions for assault and battery, aggravated assault, and other offenses.
",-1
"· A 56-year-old female Mexican national with a federal conviction for illegal entry.
",-1
"She is facing federal re-entry after deportation charges.
",-1
"All four remain in agency custody.
",-1
"The arrestees who are not being federally prosecuted will be processed administratively for removal from the United States.

"FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base
",-1
"“Motive a mystery in car explosion at Travis Air Force Base” was the Los Angeles Times headline, and this one is indeed a real mystery.
",-1
"A Muslim named Hafiz Kazi, according to the Times, “drove a burning minivan filled with propane and gas tanks into the front gate of Travis Air Force Base in Northern California.” After scrutinizing all the evidence closely, the FBI just can’t figure out what could possibly have been Kazi’s motive.
",-1
"And that in a nutshell shows what’s wrong with today’s FBI.
",-1
"Sean Ragan, FBI special agent in charge of the Sacramento field office, stated: “We don’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point.
",-1
"Now the question is, why.
",-1
"And we don’t know answers to that, quite frankly.”
",-1
"The Times noted that when emergency responders approached the burning van after it crashed, “they found five propane tanks, three plastic one-gallon gas cans, several lighters, three phones and a gym bag with personal items, Ragan said.”
",-1
"Yes, what Kazi could possibly have been up to is a complete mystery.
",-1
"The Times added that “the dead man’s religious beliefs and affiliation are not known at this point, said Ragan, who debunked a rumor that some sort of ‘jihad’ video was found on Kazi’s phone.”
",-1
"All right.
",-1
"No jihad video.
",-1
"And no “nexus of terrorism,” according to Sean Ragan.
",-1
"What is a nexus of terrorism?
",-1
"Ragan most likely means that investigators didn’t find an ISIS membership card in Kazi’s wallet, or lots of phone calls to Iraq or Syria, or a note from Kazi reading, “I did this for Allah and Islam.
",-1
"Allahu akbar.”
",-1
"Of course, even if they had found those things, given the FBI’s recent track record of denial and deception, they may still be searching for Kazi’s motive.

"(Syed Ahmed knew Abid well enough to loan him money, according to bankruptcy documents filed by Abid.)
",-1
"The FBI arrested Imran, the eldest of the three Awan brothers, at Dulles Airport trying to fly to Pakistan in July, and prosecutors charged him with fraudulently gathering money the prior winter to wire overseas, possibly in an attempt to flee the investigation into the family’s activities involving House computers.
",-1
"“Based on the suspicious timing of that transaction, Awan and [wife Hina] Alvi likely knew they were under investigation at that time” and “there are strong indications of flight in this case,” prosecutors wrote.
",-1
"Abid was making his own efforts to round up money at the same time via the life insurance policy.
",-1
"Abid then used those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary.
",-1
"When his father died on Jan. 16, 2017, the youngest Awan brother, Jamal, attested on the death certificate provided to the insurance company that his father was divorced, a statement Gilani’s lawyer said would have kept her from the money.
",-1
"A Virginia court later ruled that Jamal’s statement about his marital status on the certificate was wrong.
",-1
"On Dec. 12, 2016, Imran and Alvi – who was also on the House payroll – began taking a series of withdrawals from banks, some of which federal prosecutors say occurred under fraudulent pretenses.
",-1
"In January 2017, Imran wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan.
",-1
"Imran wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan Jan. 18, according to the indictment.
",-1
"On Jan. 17, Abid filed notarized papers using those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary.
",-1
"The life insurance change’s timing seems to coincide with other moves by Abid to liquidate property and transfer it.
",-1
"Ten weeks prior, on Nov. 1, 2016, Alvi sold a house to Jamal for $620,000, netting another significant profit from the mortgage company.
",-1
"In addition to his primary residence, Abid owned the house where his mother and stepfather lived, and moved in after his death, with Gilani becoming homeless.
",-1
"Abid owned two homes despite a $1 million 2012 bankruptcy that might ordinarily have forced him to sell the second home to pay creditors.
",-1
"At that time, he filed forms “under penalty of perjury” that two houses were needed as “my spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purposes of evading the requirements.”
",-1
"However, his wife, Ukrainian-born Nataliia Sova – who also was on the House payroll – signed as a witness on the 2016 life insurance form as “spouse of Abid,” and they have been photographed living together.
",-1
"Gilani told TheDCNF the brothers were trying to use the life insurance policy as leverage to persuade her to sign a power of attorney giving them access to “assets of my late husband in Pakistan,” which were much more valuable than the $50,000 policy.
",-1
"Gilani alleged the brothers took her financial documents, a laptop, and her husband’s possessions.
",-1
"The only lawyer she could afford, she claimed, was Michael Hadeed, a business attorney who was convicted in 2010 of conspiracy and immigration fraud for helping aliens obtain green cards by setting them up with fake employment relationships.
",-1
"He lost his bar license for two years, according to Virginia State Bar documents.
",-1
"Hadeed withdrew earlier allegations of fraud and asked the judge to try the case based solely on interpretation of contract language.
",-1
"After court, Hadeed told reporters Bacon had threatened to sue him for defamation.
",-1
"“I don’t want to subject myself to that,” he said outside court.
",-1
"“I don’t want to get myself in a lawsuit over this.”
",-1
"In court, Bacon badgered Hadeed.
",-1
"“Are you going to share any more info with them?
",-1
"I hope not.
",-1
"I hope you learned that lesson,” he said.
",-1
"Hadeed said three different signatures from Abid on financial documents did not match, and put a defiant Abid on the witness stand.
",-1
"Hadeed: You were aware you were changing beneficiary from your father’s spouse to yourself?
",-1
"Abid: That was my father’s request…
",-1
"Hadeed: You’re not answering the question.
",-1
"Abid: I’m not very smart, so it takes a while sometimes…
",-1
"Your job is to answer the question.
",-1
"In court documents, Gilani alleged, “while he was admitted in hospital my telephone conversations were taped and some other recording devices were also installed/planted in my house … Imran Awan showed up and threatened me for me calling the police.
",-1
"Based on Hadeed’s narrow legal argument about the life insurance contract’s language, the judge ruled that, “The son as the owner of the policy has the absolute right to change the beneficiary.”
",-1
"After Gilani retained a lawyer, Bacon had offered a settlement where they’d split the money, but Gilani declined it.
",-1
"The court awarded Abid the $50,000 life insurance payout, minus $5,000 that the insurance company took for its expenses in litigating the fraud allegations.
",-1
"“You should have taken the settlement.
",-1
"Now she’s not getting a penny,” Bacon said in court.
",-1
"“You’re not getting anything.”
",-1
"Gilani said after court that her conscience didn’t allow her to settle.

",-1
"Two cases of Ebola have been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), according to a government health official.
",-1
"Jean Jack Muyembe, head of the national institute for biological research, said that at least ten more cases were also suspected in the northwestern town of Bikoro.
",-1
"Local health officials in Democratic Republic of Congo reported 21 patients showing signs of hemorrhagic fever and 17 deaths in the affected area before an Ebola outbreak was confirmed on Tuesday, the health ministry said.
",-1
"Medical teams have taken five samples from suspected active cases and two tested positive for the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus, the ministry said in a statement.
",-1
"It is the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in the DRC.
",-1
"Last year, eight people were infected and four people died after an outbreak of the disease.
",-1
"The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission.
",-1
"It is believed to be spread over long distances by bats, which can host the virus without dying.
",-1
"These animals then infect other tree-dwelling creatures such as monkeys.
",-1
"Ebola can often spread to humans from infected bushmeat.
",-1
"Image: Ebola is a difficult illness to contain and efforts to stop it spreading are vital
",-1
"The World Health Organisation reports that the first Ebola outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests.
",-1
"The two-year outbreak in West Africa that began in 2014 involved major urban areas as well as rural ones.
",-1
"More than 11,300 people died and some 28,600 were infected, most of them in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
",-1
"Sporadic cases of Ebola have occurred since the epidemic was brought under control, with a small number of patients being confirmed in 2017.
",-1
"The disease was first detected in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, one in what is now Nzara, South Sudan, and the other in Yambuku in the DRC.
",-1
"The latter occurred near the River Ebola, after which the disease is named.

"Story highlights Two cases were confirmed, prompting the outbreak declaration
",-1
"In the past five weeks, there have been 21 suspected cases, including 17 deaths

"The declaration came after laboratory results confirmed two cases of the disease in the province of Bikoro in the northwestern part of the country.

"New outbreak of Ebola kills 17 in northwest DR Congo
",-1
"""Twenty-one cases of fever with haemorrhagic indications and 17 deaths"" have been recorded in Equateur province, it said, citing a notification to the ministry as of May 3.
",-1
"It is the DRC's ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976, when the deady viral disease was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team.
",-1
"In Geneva, the World Health Organization (WHO) said lab tests in the DRC confirmed the presence of Ebola virus in two out of five samples collected from patients.
",-1
"""WHO is working closely with the government of the DRC to rapidly scale up its operations and mobilize health partners, using the model of a successful response to a similar... outbreak in 2017,"" it said in a statement.
",-1
"It said it had released $1 million (840,000 euros) from an emergency contingency fund, set up a coordination group and deployed more than 50 experts to work with the DRC government and health agencies.
",-1
"""The action plan prepared by the health ministry has been approved,"" an official statement released after a cabinet meeting said.
",-1
"- No new deaths -
",-1
"""Since the notification of the cases on May 3, no deaths have been reported,"" it said, without specifying when the first case came to light.
",-1
"The outbreak occurred in Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumba.
",-1
"All the cases were reported from a clinic at Ilkoko Iponge, located about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from Bikoro, where treatment capacities are limited, the WHO said.
",-1
"A team of experts from the WHO, Doctors without Borders (DRC) and Equateur province travelled to Bikoro on Tuesday to beef up coordination and carry out investigations, it said.
",-1
"It is caused by a virus that has a natural reservoir in the bat, which does not itself fall ill, but can pass the microbe on to humans who hunt it for ""bushmeat"".
",-1
"The virus is handed on by contact with bodily fluids -- touching a sick or dead person is a well-known source of infection.
",-1
"Following an incubation period of between two and 21 days, Ebola develops into a high fever, weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat.
",-1
"That is often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding.
",-1
"The worst-ever Ebola outbreak started in December 2013 in southern Guinea before spreading to two neighbouring west African countries, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
",-1
"That outbreak killed more than 11,300 people out of nearly 29,000 registered cases, according to WHO estimates, although the real figure is thought to be significantly higher.
",-1
"More than 99 percent of victims were in the three West African countries, although cases occurred in other parts of the world, often stirring panic.
",-1
"There is no current vaccine to prevent Ebola or licensed treatment for it, although a range of experimental drugs are in development.
",-1
"Early care with rehydration may boost the chance of survival.
",-1
"Given the lack of a pharmaceutical weapon against Ebola, health experts have responded with time-honoured measures of control, prevention and containment.
",-1
"They use rigorous protocols to protect medical personnel with disposable full-body suits, masks, goggles and gloves and disinfecting sprays.

",-1
"According to the country's Health Ministry, five samples were taken from suspected cases in Bikoro.
",-1
"Out of the five samples sent to the National Institute of Biological Research in Kinshasa, two tested positive for Ebola.
",-1
"However, no deaths have been reported among those with the disease.
",-1
"""We will gather more samples, conduct contact tracing, engage the communities with messages on prevention and control and put in place methods for improving data collection and sharing,"" said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization's (WHO) regional director for Africa, following the outbreak announcement.
",-1
"""WHO will work closely with health authorities and partners to support the national response,"" Moeti added.
",-1
"This is the Congo's ninth outbreak of the virus since it was discovered in the country in 1976.
",-1
"The last outbreak occurred in the northern Bas Uele province in 2017.
",-1
"However, it was quickly contained due to swift action taken by the government and the WHO.

"Congo confirms 2 Ebola cases, declares outbreak
",-1
"KINSHASA, Congo -- Congo's government on Tuesday declared a new outbreak of Ebola in the country's rural northwest, after two cases of the deadly virus were confirmed in Bikoro.
",-1
"Congo's Health Ministry said that of five samples sent to the National Institute of Biological Research in Kinshasa, two were positive for the Zaire strain of Ebola in the country's Equateur province.
",-1
"The samples were gathered after the Equateur province Health Ministry notified Kinshasa on May 3 of some 21 cases of a hemorrhagic fever in the Ikoko Impenge area, including 17 deaths, according to the World Health Organization and Congo's government.
",-1
"There are various hemorrhagic fevers.
",-1
"A team was sent by the WHO and Doctors Without Borders over the weekend to investigate and strengthen coordination.
",-1
"The five new cases were then identified and sent to the laboratory, Congo's government said.
",-1
"Since that time, no deaths have been reported among those hospitalized or among health workers treating the ill, it said.
",-1
"A team of experts will go to Bikoro today to implement measures to avoid further spread of the disease, said the ministry statement.
",-1
"The team also will investigate how the outbreak first started, it said.
",-1
"This is the ninth Ebola outbreak in Congo since 1976, when the disease was first identified.
",-1
"Congo has a long track record with Ebola, the World Health Organization said.
",-1
"The most recent outbreak was in May 2017 and killed four of the eight people infected in Congo's Bas-Uele province in the northeast.
",-1
"That outbreak was quickly contained and was declared over in July.
",-1
"None of these outbreaks was connected to the outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone that began in 2014 and left more than 11,300 people dead.
",-1
"Ebola occasionally jumps to humans from animals, including bats and monkeys.
",-1
"Without preventive measures, the virus can spread quickly between people and is fatal in up to 90 percent of cases.
",-1
"There is no specific treatment for Ebola, which is spread through the bodily fluids of people exhibiting symptoms.
",-1
"A new experimental vaccine has been shown to be effective against the virus, though quantities are currently limited.
",-1
"WHO said Tuesday that it is working closely with Congo's government to rapidly scale up its operations and mobilize health partners as it did successfully in Congo last year.
",-1
"""Our top priority is to get to Bikoro to work alongside the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and partners to reduce the loss of life and suffering related to this new Ebola virus disease outbreak,"" said Dr. Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response.
",-1
"""Working with partners and responding early and in a coordinated way will be vital to containing this deadly disease.""

"DRC: Fresh Ebola outbreak kills two in Equateur Province
",-1
"The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that it was taking steps to help deal with a new outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo's rural northwest, after two cases of the deadly virus were confirmed in the market town of Bikoro.
",-1
"Congo's Health Ministry said two of the five samples it sent to the National Institute of Biological Research in Kinshasa, came back positive for the disease.
",-1
"The samples were gathered after health officials in Equateur Province notified Kinshasa on May 3 of about 21 cases of a hemorrhagic fever in the Ikoko Impenge area, including 17 deaths, according to WHO and Congo's government.
",-1
"What is Ebola?
",-1
"Rare but deadly, the viral disease is most commonly affecting primates and humans.
",-1
"Initial symptoms can include fever, headache, joint and muscle aches, weakness, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pain lack of appetite and in some cases internal and external bleeding, according to WHO.
",-1
"Where did it originate from?
",-1
"Ebola virus disease (EVD) was first discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks.
",-1
"One in what is now Nzara in South Sudan.
",-1
"The other outbreak in Yambuku in Zaire in what is now DR Congo.
",-1
"The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.
",-1
"Why is it so dangerous?
",-1
"The average Ebola fatality rate is about 50 percent.
",-1
"But the rates have varied from 25 percent to 90 percent in recent outbreaks.
",-1
"There is as of yet no proven cure available for Ebola, though some vaccines are being tested.
",-1
"Some people who have recovered from Ebola have developed long-term complications, such as joint and vision problems.
",-1
"It is not known why some people recover from Ebola while most succumb to the disease.
",-1
"Why does it keep coming back?
",-1
"The disease infects humans through close contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope.
",-1
"In Africa where most outbreaks happen, particular species of fruit bats are considered natural hosts for the Ebola virus.
",-1
"Infected bats are believed to transmit the disease to humans, or indirectly through other animals that are hunted for their meat.
",-1
"The family of the first victim of the 2014 outbreak, a two-year-old child, hunted bats and it is believed bushmeat was the origin of the outbreak.
",-1
"An estimated five million tonnes of bushmeat is consumed on the continent every year, according to the Centre for International Forestry Research.
",-1
"The virus then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments.
",-1
"Even funerals of Ebola victims can be a risk, if mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased.
",-1

"The Democratic Republic Congo is facing the familiar challenge of containing yet another Ebola outbreak.
",-1
"Since confirming the outbreak on Tuesday (May 8), DR Congo’s health ministry now says 17 people have died in Bikoro, a town in the northwest Equateur province.
",-1
"It’s the ninth Ebola outbreak in DR Congo since the virus which causes hemorrhagic fever was discovered in the country in 1976.

"The most recent outbreak came in May 2017 and killed four people before it was contained.

"The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo #DRC declared a new outbreak of #Ebola in Bikoro, Equateur province today.
",-1
"Laboratory results confirmed two cases.
",-1
"— WHO (@WHO) May 8, 2018
",-1
"The outbreak has prompted urgent action from the World Health Organization (WHO) which has dispatched a team to the country and has released $1 million to support response efforts to stop the virus from spreading.
",-1
"Ebola is transmitted among people through human contact and has a case fatality rate of 50%.
",-1
"Health officials will wait to record two 21-day incubation cycles of the virus without any new cases before declaring the outbreak over.
",-1
"Depending on the scale of the new outbreak the health ministry might turn to rVSV-ZEBOV, an experimental vaccine which showed signs of promise during testing.
",-1
"Despite its repeated outbreaks however, DR Congo typically records low fatalities thanks to experienced medical staff and public awareness campaigns.
",-1
"As outbreaks typically occur in remote villages, they have also been easier to contain.

"The dangers of a wider outbreak were apparent in 2014 when an Ebola epidemic hit West Africa with Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone the worst affected nations.

"Leaked Doc Reveals White House Planning “Regime Change” In Iran
",-1
"It appears Rudy Giuliani wasn’t lying.
",-1
"The plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including – who else – National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009, writes the Free Beacon, which obtained a leaked copy of the circulating plans.
",-1
"The regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton—a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change—entered the White House.
",-1
"It deemphasizes U.S military intervention, instead focusing on a series of moves to embolden an Iranian population that has increasingly grown angry at the ruling regime for its heavy investments in military adventurism across the region.
",-1
"–Free Beacon
",-1
"“The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation, while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command,” SSG writes in the paper.
",-1
"“This has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months” it further claims as an argument to push a “regime change” policy.
",-1
"For now – at least – overthrowing the Iran government, with its extensive and close ties to the Kremlin, is not official US policy; SSG president Jim Hanson told the Free Beacon that the Trump administration does not want to engage in direct military intervention in Iran – and is instead focusing on other methods of ridding Iran of its “hardline ruling regime.”
",-1
"“The Trump administration has no desire to roll tanks in an effort to directly topple the Iranian regime,” Hanson said.
",-1
"“But they would be much happier dealing with a post-Mullah government.
",-1
"That is the most likely path to a nuclear weapons-free and less dangerous Iran.”
",-1
"One source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, solidified the Iranian regime’s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change
",-1
"“The JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the Islamic Republic,” said the source, who would only speak to the Free Beacon on background about the sensitive issue.
",-1
"“Prior to that, everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism.
",-1
"It’s now Trump, Bolton, and [Mike] Pompeo’s job to put this consensus back in place.”
",-1
"The source tells the Beacon that Bolton is “acutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region.”
",-1
"“John is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally, and knows that you’re never going to fundamentally change its behavior—and the threats against Israel and the Saudis especially—until that revolutionary regime is gone,” the source said, adding that “nothing’s off the table right now if Israel is attacked.”
",-1
"That said, Bolton is confident that an Iranian regime change will occur in the next six months:

",-1
"“The problem is not the Iran nuclear deal it’s the Iranian regime,” said the source.
",-1
"“Team Bolton has spent years creating Plans B, C, and D for dealing with that problem.
",-1
"President Trump hired him knowing all of that.
",-1
"Regional sources who have spoken to SSG “tell us that Iranian social media is more outraged about internal oppression, such as the recent restrictions on Telegram, than about supporting or opposing the nuclear program.
",-1
"Iranian regime oppression of its ethnic and religious minorities has created the conditions for an effective campaign designed to splinter the Iranian state into component parts,” the group states.
",-1
"“More than one third of Iran’s population is minority groups, many of whom already seek independence,” the paper explains.
",-1
"“U.S.
",-1
"support for these independence movements, both overt and covert, could force the regime to focus attention on them and limit its ability to conduct other malign activities.”
",-1
"Without a regime change, the United States will continue face threats from Iranian forces stationed throughout the region, including in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon.
",-1
"“The probability the current Iranian theocracy will stop its nuclear program willingly or even under significant pressure is low,” the plan states.
",-1
"That said, President Trump made clear earlier in the week that US officials must make efforts to differentiate between the people of Iran and its ruling regime.
",-1
"“Any public discussion of these options, and any messaging about the Iranian regime in general, should make a bright line distinction between the theocratic regime along with its organs of oppression and the general populace,” according to the plan.
",-1
"“We must constantly reinforce our support for removing the iron sandal from the necks of the people to allow them the freedom they deserve.”

"WATCH: John Bolton Promises Room Full of ‘Former Terrorists’ the US Would ‘Overthrow’ Iran by 2019
",-1
"For those who may not be paying attention, the plan to overthrow Iran has long been in the works.
",-1
"In fact, in April 2012, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained (Mojahedin-e Khalq) MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009 for this very purpose.
",-1
"MEK is the Iranian political-militant organization that advocates for the violent overthrow of the current Iranian regime.
",-1
"They are hardly quiet about it.
",-1
"According to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009.
",-1
"Comments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
",-1
"It was widely reported that the MEK was behind the anti-government violence that erupted in Iran in January which snowballed into the situation today.
",-1
"Hersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including former CIA directors James Woolsey and Porter Goss; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N.
",-1
"Ambassador John Bolton.
",-1
"For over a decade, Bolton has been calling for regime change in Iran.
",-1
"Now, he’s the National Security Advisor.
",-1
"“There is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today.
",-1
"I had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs’ regime in Tehran.
",-1
"The behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself.
",-1
"And that’s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!”
",-1
"Well, the entire event was actually put on by the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, also known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK.
",-1
"As Politico pointed out in a 2016 article, despite the neocon attempts to rewrite history, MEK have killed Americans and committed multiple acts of terrorism.
",-1
"For decades, and based on U.S. intelligence, the United States government has blamed the MEK for killing three U.S. Army colonels and three U.S. contractors, bombing the facilities of numerous U.S. companies and killing innocent Iranians.
",-1
"To those paying attention over the years, Trump’s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media and from all sides of the political spectrum should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report.
",-1
"This was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense.
",-1
"“This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years,” Clark said.
",-1
"“Starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.”

"Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran
",-1
"Apparently, the US didn't learn from its first dealings in regime change decades ago and is now prepared to give it another shot, according to leaked documents.
",-1
"Don't get me wrong here.
",-1
"I'm not for the government of Iran.
",-1
"Overall, the people of Iran are probably some decent people, but those in leadership have issues, but that is something for the people there to deal with.
",-1
"Iran is not an actual threat to the united States.
",-1
"The Washington Free Beacon reports:
",-1
"The Trump administration is examining a new plan to help Iranians fighting the hardline regime in Iran following America's exit from the landmark nuclear deal and reimposition of harsh economic sanctions that could topple a regime already beset by protests and a crashing economy, according to a copy of the plan obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.
",-1
"The three-page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials in the White House offers a strategy by which the Trump administration can actively work to assist an already aggravated Iranian public topple the hardline ruling regime through a democratization strategy that focuses on driving a deeper wedge between the Iranian people and the ruling regime.
",-1
"The plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009.
",-1
"Ah, yes, John Bolton.
",-1
"While I applaud Bolton for his willingness to call Islamic jihadis just that, I am not so naive as to consider that his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations has no effect in this decision.
",-1
"""The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation, while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command,"" SSG writes in the paper.
",-1
"""This has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months.""
",-1
"Well, why is that?
",-1
"It's due to sanctions imposed by the likes of the US.
",-1
"As has been pointed out before, sanctions hurt the people, not the governments that lead them and then those same governments use the effects to propagandize the people against those who are ordering the sanctions.
",-1
"I'm not saying the Iranian government is good, but it is Iran's government.
",-1
"Honestly, I see a ton of corruption and warmongering in our own government that rivals some of that of governments that America stands against.
",-1
"Still, as was pointed out by Matt Agorist, Bolton told an audience of the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran:
",-1
"And again, this really has nothing to do with the US.
",-1
"One source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, solidified the Iranian regime’s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change.
",-1
"The source told the Beacon that Bolton is “acutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region.”
",-1
"OK, I get they may pose a danger, but let's look at the reality here.
",-1
"Those they pose a danger to, namely Saudi Arabia and Israel can both fend perfectly well for themselves and have demonstrated that ability to do it.
",-1
"There is no need for the US to be involved in it in any way.
",-1
"Why should we be fighting a battle or encouraging, funding, and I'm quite sure arming, a rebellion?
",-1
"Simple.
",-1
"It isn't.
",-1
"I care little for the Saudi government as they help push Sharia and is the land where many of the 9-11 hijackers came from.
",-1
"The Iranian government I care for even less, but out of each of those, which one should America have dealt with militarily following 9-11?
",-1
"Both, if you're going to go by information that we have a record on.
",-1
"Why can't America focus on it's own issues and solve those?
",-1
"It's because we are too busy trying to police the world, keeping the spotlight off of those in our government who are attacking our rights and spending us into more and more debt.
",-1
"And lest you think this is about the nuclear deal.
",-1
"“The problem is not the Iran nuclear deal it’s the Iranian regime,” the source told the Beacon.
",-1
"Bolton says it will be accomplished in the next six months.
",-1
"I don't doubt it.
",-1
"Notice some things that are taking place in Iran that the plan speaks about.
",-1
"President Trump did made clear earlier in the week that we must make efforts to differentiate between the people of Iran and its ruling regime.
",-1
"Well, I agree, but that gets real messy when you start intervening in this manner.
",-1
"But the Trump administration has spoken out on other countries where the people want their independence.
",-1
"Remember the Kurds?
",-1
"How about the people in the Catalan region of Spain?
",-1
"No support for those people, and why?
",-1
"Cause it's not part of the agenda.
",-1
"I say if the Iranian people want their freedom, let them first free themselves from the bondage of Islam, and then let the passion that burns inside men to be free rise up as it did in our forefathers due to the teachings fo the Holy Scriptures and stand and fight.
",-1
"Then, they will be in a position to ask for aid, but only then.
",-1
"Trump’s Plan for Iran: Put Terrorists in Charge?
",-1
"Back in the 2008 presidential race, I explained to then-candidate Rudy Giuliani the concept of “blowback.” Years of US meddling and military occupation of parts of the Middle East motivated a group of terrorists to carry out attacks against the United States on 9/11.
",-1
"They didn’t do it because we are so rich and so free, as the neocons would have us believe.
",-1
"They came over here because we had been killing Muslims “over there” for decades.
",-1
"How do we know this?
",-1
"Well, they told us.
",-1
"Osama bin Laden made it clear why al-Qaeda sought to attack the US.
",-1
"They didn’t like the US taking sides in the Israel-Palestine conflict and they didn’t like US troops on their holy land.
",-1
"Why believe a terrorist, some responded.
",-1
"As I explained to Giuliani ten years ago, the concept of “blowback” is well-known in the US intelligence community and particularly by the CIA.
",-1
"Unfortunately, it is clear that Giuliani never really understood what I was trying to tell him.
",-1
"Like the rest of the neocons, he either doesn’t get it or doesn’t want to get it.
",-1
"Giuliani shares with numerous other neocons like John Bolton a strong relationship with this group.
",-1
"In fact, both Giuliani and Bolton have been on the payroll of the MeK and have received tens of thousands of dollars to speak to their followers.
",-1
"This is another example of how foreign lobbies and special interest groups maintain an iron grip on our foreign policy.
",-1
"How did that work in Libya?
",-1
"It’s easy to dismiss the bombastic Giuliani as he speaks to his financial benefactors in the MeK.
",-1
"Unfortunately, however, Giuliani’s claims were confirmed late last week, when the Washington Free Beacon published a three-page policy paper being circulated among National Security Council officials containing plans to spark regime change in Iran.
",-1
"The paper suggests that the US focus on Iran’s many ethnic minority groups to spark unrest and an eventual overthrow of the government.
",-1
"This is virtually the same road map that the US has followed in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and so on.
",-1
"We know from 9/11 that blowback is real, even if Giuliani and the neocons refuse to understand it.
",-1
"Iran does not threaten the United States.
",-1

"In the week since we first noted the new outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the number of cases has risen by 50%, and The World Health Organization has now said it is preparing for “the worst case scenario.”
",-1
"The WHO has tallied 32 suspected or confirmed cases in the northwestern area of Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumbathe near the border with the Republic of Congo, including 18 deaths, between April 4 and May 9.
",-1
"The outbreak, declared by the DRC health ministry on Tuesday, is the DRC’s ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976,when the deadly viral disease was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team.
",-1
"Scientists are greatly concerned that this outbreak in the remote Bikoro region will travel 175 miles to the city of Mbandaka – the capital of Equateur province and home to around 1.2 million residents.

"We’ve updated this map.

"-Daily Mail
",-1

"Scientists believe Ebola is most often passed to humans by fruit bats, however porcupines, gorillas, antelope and chimpanzees could also be carriers.
",-1
"It is transmitted between humans through blood, secretions and other bodily fluids (and surfaces) of those infected.
",-1
"There is currently no “proven” treatment for Ebola, however dozens of experimental drugs exist – including a vaccine called rVSV-ZEBOV, which has reportedly protected nearly 6,000 people.

"The BBC reports that Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga confirmed a case in Mbandaka, a city of a million people about 130km (80 miles) from the area where the first cases were confirmed earlier this month.

"“We have urban Ebola, which is a very different animal from rural Ebola.

"“This puts a whole different lens on this outbreak and gives us increased urgency to move very quickly into Mbandaka to stop this new first sign of transmission,” he said.
",-1
"The BBC adds that the WHO said it was not recommending any trade or travel restrictions either within DR Congo, for example between Mbandaka and Kinshasa, or internationally.
",-1
"But Mr Salama said that 13 countries in the region were boosting border screening measures and said DR Congo itself was increasing exit screening measures.

"“The good news is that the DR Congo population is very used to Ebola outbreaks,” he added.
",-1
"“They know to protect themselves by avoiding mass gatherings and mass funerals.

"As The Daily Mail notes, it is the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in Congo since the disease made its first known appearance near its northern Ebola river in the 1970s.

",-1
"Name This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

"“Christian Parent Furious After School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah,” by Joshua Gill, Daily Caller News Foundation, May 17, 2018 (thanks to the Geller Report):
",-1
"The packet, edited from the full version of a world religions workbook, instructed students to practice writing the Shahada, or Islamic profession of faith, in Arabic calligraphy — an assignment that, if left undone, would result in detention, according to Penkoski’s daughter.
",-1
"“I saw the assignment of writing the Shahada in Arabic.
",-1
"Their excuse was calligraphy,” Penkoski told The Christian Post.
",-1
"“I was like, ‘Whoa!
",-1
"Whoa!
",-1
"Whoa!’ First of all, calligraphy was invented in China 3,000 years prior to Muhammad.
",-1
"My daughter is not doing that.’ My daughter told me that if she didn’t do the assignment, then she was going to get a [detention] slip,” Penkoski added….
",-1
"There were two different calligraphy assignments — one involving the Shahada and another instructing students to practice writing English letters in calligraphy, Branch told Christian Post.
",-1
"Hinson “told the students that they could do these activities if they wanted,” Branch claimed.
",-1
"“The teacher has told her class several times that this is a study of world religions and that she is not trying to advocate for any religion over another.
",-1
"She has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs, that those conversations should take place with their parents,” Branch added.
",-1
"Penkoski claimed the teacher sent students home with the same packet the day after he lodged a complaint — this time, with certain sections crossed out but still including the Shahada assignment.
",-1
"Penkoksi called the principal again and confronted Hinson over the phone.
",-1
"“I said, ‘This is not OK in asking my kid to write down the Shahada.’ The teacher happened to walk-in and said she made it an option and that the kids didn’t have to do it.
",-1
"My daughter conflicted that story and said, ‘No, that is not what was said.’ What was said was, ‘Do the assignment; and if you want to learn more about the Quran, ask your parents,’” Penkoski told Christian Post.
",-1
"Each religion studied in the class, including Christianity and Judaism, received “equitable treatment,” Branch also told Christian Post.
",-1
"He said the class spent a week and a half on Christianity and Judaism — other religions took one week — and discussed each religion’s beliefs, history and practices.
",-1
"During the section on Christianity, “Jesus was taught,” Branch claimed.
",-1
"“The students read the chapter in our textbook that discusses Christianity’s belief that Jesus is the Son of God, and salvation.
",-1
"They also discussed the Sermon on the Mount, the Last Supper and Jesus’ Betrayal, the Trinity, and the Lord’s Prayer, among other topics,” Branch said.
",-1
"Penkoski and his daughter, Brielle, contested Branch’s claims.
",-1
"The Lord’s Prayer was not taught, and very little time was spent teaching about Jesus, they told Christian Post.
",-1
"“We did [the unit on Christianity] over a week and two days.
",-1
"We watched two different videos.
",-1
"We didn’t finish them.
",-1
"They taught a little bit about Moses and the Ten Commandments, Peter and Paul,” Brielle explained.
",-1
"“We learned about the Israelites and how they are being persecuted by the Romans.
",-1
"We were told about the Jews and told a little bit about Jesus.” Penkoski also shared with Christian Post the packets on Christianity and Judaism passed out in class and allegedly modified from the original full version.
",-1
"While the packet on Islam contained verses from the Koran, the packets for those religions did not contain scripture and did not encourage students to write prayers or faith statements, he said.
",-1
"“Notice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord’s Prayer,” he said.
",-1
"“[There’s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet,” he added….
",-1
"The Islamization of the Public Schools
",-1
"Muslims anxious to use schools and textbooks to proselytize for Islam have found a welcoming environment in American public schools that are indefatigably committed to multiculturalism.
",-1
"Many of the Islamic groups that vet American public school textbooks for the accuracy of their material on Islamic doctrine and history are Saudi-funded.
",-1
"We have seen this just recently, when Mountain Ridge Middle School in Gerrardstown, West Virginia instructed students to copy out the Islamic profession of faith (shahada), ostensibly as a calligraphy exercise.
",-1
"Parent Rich Penkoski recounted: “I saw the assignment of writing the Shahada in Arabic.
",-1
"Their excuse was calligraphy.
",-1
"I was like, ‘Whoa!
",-1
"The fact that they were trying to get my daughter to write that disturbed me.
",-1
"I said, ‘That is not happening.
",-1
"My daughter is not doing that.’ My daughter told me that if she didn’t do the assignment, then she was going to get a [detention] slip.”
",-1
"Branch contradicted Penkoski, claiming: “The teacher has told her class several times that this is a study of world religions and that she is not trying to advocate for any religion over another.
",-1
"She has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs, that those conversations should take place with their parents.” He said that Christianity and Judaism were given “equitable treatment” in the same class.
",-1
"Penkoski’s daughter, Brielle, however, said that the class spent much less time on Christianity and Judaism than it did on Islam.
",-1
"Penkoski pointed out that the accompanying exercises were also less extensive for Christianity and Judaism than they were for Islam: “Notice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord’s Prayer.
",-1
"[There’s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet.”
",-1
"The complaint adds: “Due to the fact that these doctrinal messages calling for conversion to Islam were included in video format with vivid images and text, they possess greater communicative impact and are more likely to be accepted by the students viewing them than information that is spoken in a classroom or even written in a book.”
",-1
"These accounts are not singular.
",-1
"High school students in Newton, Massachusetts in October 2017, according to Fox News, “pretended to be Muslims in the ‘Islamic’ city of Jerusalem as part of a class assignment.” The assignment also included a pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel article.
",-1
"Meanwhile, Georgia parent Michelle King noted in 2016: “My daughter had to learn the Shahid and the Five Pillars of Islam, which is what you learn to convert,” while not teaching Christianity or the Ten Commandments.
",-1
"One homework assignment in Walton County, Georgia, stated: “Allah is the [blank] worshiped by Jews & Christians,” with students having to fill in the blank with “same God.”
",-1
"“They are not going to learn any other religion, doctrines or creeds and they are not going back over this chapter.
",-1
"Even though they discuss Christianity a little bit during the Middle Ages, they are not ever going to have this basis for Judaism or Christianity later.”
",-1
"None of the encroachments of Islam in public schools should come as any real surprise.
",-1
"Multiculturalism, after all, amounts to respect for every culture except one’s own.
",-1
"The embarrassment, regret, and even self-hatred that has been inculcated in American public school students for decades now has created a vacuum, which Muslims have shown themselves to be all too eager to fill.
",-1
"Certainly, those who are furthering the Islamization of the schools would deny that they would like to see Islamic law implemented in the United States, and would indignantly reject the claim that their efforts were furthering that end in any way.
",-1
"They would say that they are doing it all for tolerance, pluralism, and multiculturalism.
",-1
"Unfortunately, in the end, it amounts to the same thing.

"EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs
",-1
"The vaccination campaign will begin today.
",-1
"“The vaccination campaign begins tomorrow, Monday, in Mbandaka, capital of the province,” Minister of Health Oly Ilunga told The Associated Press as reported by 9 News Australia.
",-1
"An experimental vaccine is one that has never been tried on humans before.
",-1
"Ebola hemorrhagic fever, seen mostly only in Africa, is one of the world’s most feared diseases.
",-1
"It begins with flu-like symptoms, followed by bloody diarrhea and vomiting.
",-1
"Days later, some victims begin bleeding through the nose, mouth, and eyes.
",-1
"There is no cure for Ebola.
",-1
"The virus is spread through direct contact with the blood or secretions of an infected person.
",-1
"The death toll has reached 26 and the vaccine will be rolled out at Mbandaka, the north-western city of 1.2 million recently struck by the outbreak.
",-1
"Since the virus is spread through direct contact, an isn’t airborne, it isn’t nearly as deadly as it could be.
",-1
"Read more here about Ebola and how it is transmitted:
",-1
"Initially, the campaign will target 600 people, mainly medical staff, contacts of suspected cases, and those who have been in contact with the contacts, Ilunga said.
",-1
"Officials are working urgently to prevent the disease from spreading beyond Mbandaka, which lies on the Congo River, a busy traffic corridor, and is an hour’s flight from the capital.
",-1
"The fever can cause severe internal bleeding that is often fatal.
",-1
"Meaning, the virus itself doesn’t actually kill.
",-1
"The immune system’s response to the virus is what’s deadly.
",-1
"ZMapp is also an experimental drug that could aid in the recovery from the Ebola virus.
",-1
"But, like the vaccine being administered, it has not been tested for safety or efficacy yet.
",-1
"It is not a vaccine – it is a therapeutic drug.
",-1
"Of the seven people given the drug so far, two have died.
",-1
"ZMapp show “promise,” although scientific results are not definitive.
",-1
"The WHO, however, stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global health emergency.
",-1
"WHO said there should not be restrictions on international travel or trade.
",-1
"In the meantime, it’s important to prevent oneself from contracting the virus.
",-1
"Unfortunately, health care workers are at the greatest risk as they try to cull the suffering: which is why they will be the first to get the experimental vaccine.

"US and Chinese authorities are investigating the matter after the employee, who was assigned to the southern city of Guangzhou, was diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), said embassy spokeswoman Jinnie Lee.
",-1
"In an alert emailed to US citizens in China, the embassy said it does not know what caused the symptoms or of any similar situations in the country.
",-1
"In Cuba last year, the US disclosed that 24 diplomats and their family members had fallen victim to an unsolved mysterious attack that left them with injuries resembling brain trauma.

"""We cannot at this time connect it with what happened in Havana but we are investigating all possibilities,"" a US embassy official in Beijing told AFP on the condition of anonymity.

"The US government has held Cuba responsible, arguing that Raul Castro's authoritarian state must have either carried out the assaults or at least known who was behind them.

"Canadian and US authorities had initially suspected a ""sonic attack"" or a ""mass psychosomatic incident"", but those are ""now considered unlikely"", a senior Canadian official said.
",-1
"The symptoms included dizziness, headaches and a lack of ability to concentrate.
",-1
"Unlike their American counterparts, however, no Canadian envoy reported hearing any suspicious sound prior to falling ill.

"Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders
",-1
"The Francis Vatican’s approach to the contemplative life is probably the most illustrative of our entire crisis.
",-1
"Contemplative life is aimed only at a purely supernatural end.
",-1
"It has no “use” in the sense that either the Bergoglians – in terms of their political machinations – or the world can understand.
",-1
"There is probably no other place where the differences between the two programmes - the Catholic programme of Christ and the Bergoglian/Kasperian programme - are more sharply contrasted.
",-1
"One aspect of Pope Francis’ character that seems little-explored by the Catholic and secular media alike is his apparent disdain for contemplative religious life – a facet of Catholic life that could be described as the most purely religious of all the Church’s undertakings.
",-1
"The world does not understand it or want it.
",-1
"Therefore, it is something of a thorn in the Bergoglian side, and he has repeatedly expressed his contempt for it.
",-1
"So when, in 2016 he issued a document on contemplative nuns, the faithful braced for impact .
",-1
"Italian Vaticanist Marco Tosatti commented dryly, “Rejoice and be glad… but not if you’re a cloistered contemplative.”
",-1
"Unfortunately, it was about a subject that the world, and therefore the modern Church, cares so little about that hardly anyone noticed.
",-1
"Aimed specifically at female contemplative religious, the document threatened that in a year or so another would be forthcoming laying out precisely what would now be required of nuns to continue in their vocations.
",-1
"The new document issued last week, “Cor orans,” is juridical, that is, it is not much more than a list of specific norms, or rules – 289 of them!
",-1
"– that all communities of contemplative nuns must now follow.
",-1
"One odd remark in article 19 is maybe the most succinct description of the direction planned for contemplatives:
",-1
"“A monastery of nuns, as every religious house, is erected while keeping in mind its usefulness for the Church and for the Institute.” (emphasis added)
",-1
"Wait… its “usefulness”?
",-1
"I think a fair question for the Faithful to ask this Vatican department might be, “According to what specific criteria is a monastery’s ‘usefulness’ actually determined?”
",-1
"One can’t help but hearken back to the criteria for monasteries that were allowed to survive the revolutionary purges in 18th and 19th century Europe.
",-1
"A house that could prove to the secularists that it was “useful” – that it could care for the indigent elderly, teach children or nurse the sick – would be allowed to continue.
",-1
"Those which were purely contemplative – a single-minded devotion to the adoration of God – were closed.
",-1
"Rupture?
",-1
"What rupture?
",-1
"The first thing Cor orans does is claim continuity with both pre and post-Vatican II theology.
",-1
"In the Introduction, it seems anxious to establish a “hermeneutic of continuity” with Pius XII and his document Sponsa Christi Ecclesia of 1950.
",-1
"The authors insist there is no contradiction between the two – except, of course, where there are contradictions – and that both Pius XII and Francis are keen to see nuns reaching the “aim of their specific vocation.” It describes Francis as promulgating this document “in the wake” of Pius XII[1].
",-1
"In fact, Pope Francis, by promulgating the Apostolic Constitution Vultum Dei quaerere, on June 29, 2016, to help the contemplatives reach the aim of their specific vocation, invited reflection and discernment on the precise content tied to consecrated life in general and to the monastic tradition in particular, but he did not intend to abrogate Sponsa Christi Ecclesia that was derogated only in some points.
",-1
"As a consequence, the two pontifical documents are to be held as normative in force for monasteries of nuns and must be read in a unitary vision.
",-1
"But of course, the entire game is given away in the next paragraph:
",-1
"Yes, that’s what it said.
",-1
"How do you know?
",-1
"Because we’re telling you it has.”
",-1
"This is what might be considered the guiding principle of the document; “Nothing to see here.
",-1
"And if you say there is, you’re the problem.”
",-1
"It’s your fault if you find contradictions, not theirs; they’ve said there are no contradictions, therefore there aren’t any.
",-1
"After all, this is the papacy where 2 + 2 = 5 if the pope says it does.
",-1
"Why would the Vatican need a document giving extensive norms for the closure of monasteries that have too few nuns or do not follow their originally intended charisms if everything about the religious life since Vatican II has been hunky dory?
",-1
"Let’s remember that this comes from the Congregation for Religious of Braz de’Aviz and Jose Rodriguez Carballo.
",-1
"This is the Cardinal Braz de’Aviz[2] who wasted no time in orienting himself in the New Paradigm when, close on the heels of the Conclave he slammed the attempt by his predecessor – and by extension Pope Benedict – to reign in the notorious Leadership Conference of Women Religious in the US.
",-1
"Apparently the total statistical collapse of the religious life following Vatican II[3] had nothing to do with the massive systemic changes to the forms of that life – always claimed to be “mandated” by “the Council”.
",-1
"Independence
",-1
"But that word does not mean what they think it means.
",-1
"If the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery.
",-1
"When an autonomous monastery , it is the responsibility ofto the Holy See.
",-1
"As we will see, the federations are now a multilayered system of internal surveillance and centralised control that leaves Orwell in the dust:
",-1
"overcome isolation and promote regular observance and contemplative life.
",-1
"Federation of monasteries means a structure of communion among some autonomous monasteries of the same Institute [4] , erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, so that in sharing the same charism, the federated monasteriesand promote regular observance and contemplative life.
",-1
"Note the change: “independent” is replaced with “isolated[5].” It reminds me of a conversation I had with a superior of a Benedictine house in the UK.
",-1
"She said she thought that the psychiatric testing, that in 2008 was still all the rage among the houses of her monastery’s federation, was excessive and not helpful.
",-1
"She didn’t trust the heavily secularised field of psychology to help in determining a candidate’s suitability for religious life, so she didn’t require these tests of her monastery’s postulants.
",-1
"She also said that she was under constant pressure, both the subtle pressure of general peer disapproval and overt requests to conform by the federation’s leadership.
",-1
"Was that monastery “isolated”?
",-1
"Or just exercising lawful self-governance?
",-1
"The word “fidelity” appears in the document four times, which may give an idea of how much interest the Vatican has in this issue.
",-1
"As we shall see, the document is what I’ve called above a “chopping block”.
",-1
"Vultum dei quaerere made it clear that this juridical document would provide a set of legal criteria by which a monastery can be considered viable, religious life worthy of life, so to speak, and that those considered to have failed the test would be closed.
",-1
"Note the language used here:
",-1
"It jogged a memory for me.
",-1
"“Incapacity”… Where had I heard that language used before?
",-1
"Most pro-life observers in Britain will tell you that it was the “Mental Capacity Act” of 2005 that established in British law the concept that a person with permanently “reduced capacity” could be legally starved and/or dehydrated to death by doctors.
",-1
"This set of criteria is being applied in medical institutions across the western world now, a “new paradigm” of ethics replacing traditional “Hippocratic” or “Natural Law” medical ethics.
",-1
"Under this system the onus, effectively, is on the patient to prove according to the new criteria that he is worthy of receiving medical treatment – of continuing to live.
",-1
"Health care systems like that of the UK have government regulatory boards giving out “guidelines” to determine in a uniform way how health care resources are allocated.
",-1
"These guidelines are collated by professional Bioethicists applying their utilitarian criteria.
",-1
"If the equation doesn’t come out in the patient’s favour, the “treatment” recommended for the patient’s “best interests” will include his demise, often procured by withdrawing nutrition and hydration and/or administering slowly lethal doses of sedatives.
",-1
"The NHS in the UK has actually gone to court, and won, declaring that they must retain the right to kill patients who fail the Bioethics test.
",-1
"In one case a man with ALS took the NHS to court in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to preemptively preclude his medical murder when his illness left him incapacitated.
",-1
"The system, in other words, is stacked against the patient, in favour of the government that holds all the cards.
",-1
"Keep these facts in mind as we read through the rest of the document.
",-1
"Federations as Vatican watchdogs
",-1
"Under this law, all monasteries of contemplative nuns must belong to a federation.
",-1
"Previously only voluntary and consultative, federations will now have the power to supervise and guide the formation of candidates, nuns and of their formators, as well as possess broad powers over temporal goods of individual monasteries and powers of suppression.
",-1
"The Federal Assembly:
",-1
"deals with issues of major importance; makes decisions and issues norms that all nuns are required to observe, after the definitive approval of the Holy See;
",-1
"More than just federations; a multi-tier system of control
",-1
"In other words, Benedictine federations of a given area will form a “Conference” with Carmelite federations and Dominican federations and Poor Clare federations, etc.
",-1
"This will be of interest to Carmelite houses especially, since they tend to be generally more on the “conservative” end of things.
",-1
"Imagine a house of traditional Carmelites attending regional Conference meetings – and attempting to keep up their Office schedule – with the balloons-and-guitars, break dancing Franciscans…What fun!
",-1
"And finally, just in case one entire federation decides to turn back the clock, there will be an umbrella for the umbrellas; there will be watchers watching the watchers:
",-1
"Confederation means a structure of connection among Federations of monasteries, erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, for the study of themes relative to contemplative life in relation to the same charism, to give unitary direction and a certain coordination to the activity of the individual Federations.
",-1
"Broad powers
",-1
"Federations will now have extremely broad powers both over money and property and, crucially, over formation of nuns.
",-1
"It is the Federation that now has the power to monitor for compliance with the rules, to report non-compliance to the Holy See, to make new foundations and, apparently, to “encourage” individual monasteries to “communicate” their goods.
",-1
"The legitimately established Federation is a public juridic person in the Church and is therefore able to acquire, possess, administer, and alienate temporal, movable and immovable goods, which are ecclesiastical assets, in accordance with the universal and proper law.
",-1
"To keep alive and strengthen the union of monasteries, implementing one of the aims of the Federation, a certain communication of goods is encouraged among the monasteries, coordinated by the Federal President.
",-1
"The communication of goods in a Federation is implemented through contributions, gifts, loans that monasteries offer other monasteries that have financial difficulties, and for the common needs of the Federation.
",-1
"The Federation considers the assets in its possession as necessary and useful means to achieve its goals.
",-1
"Financial incentives
",-1
"Given that we shall see below that the provisions for suppression of monasteries include vague and indefinable qualities like “vitality in living and transmitting the charism” and “dynamic fidelity” to the order’s charism, and that the goods of extinct monasteries will be assumed by the federation, one might be forgiven for asking if this creates an incentive to see to it that certain houses go extinct[8].
",-1
"Since the document provides several mechanisms by which a federation can move nuns out of a monastery, this could be one of those indelicate questions some superiors might want to keep in mind.
",-1
"Article 94 requires that once it is canonically erected the federation is to seek “legal recognition also in the civil sphere.” This, presumably, will bear upon legal disputes in civil courts over the property of suppressed monasteries.
",-1
"Article 73, on the disposition of the material assets of a monastery that has gone completely extinct:
",-1
"In the event of the suppression of a totally extinct monastery, when there are no surviving nuns, unless otherwise provided by the Holy See, the destination of the suppressed monastery's assets, in compliance with canon and civil law, go to the respective higher juridical person, that is, to the Federation of monasteries or to another structure of communion among the monasteries equal to it or to the female monastic Congregation.
",-1
"The economic fund [of the federation] is nourished by the free donations of the monasteries, by the donations of benefactors, and by revenues deriving from the alienation of the assets of suppressed monasteries, as established by the present Instruction.
",-1
"Federations in charge of formation
",-1
"The Federation President, in particular, watches over initial and ongoing formation in the monasteries to see if it is in conformity with the charism proper to the Institute, so that every community may be a beacon that illumines the journey of the men and women of our time.
",-1
"At the end of the visit, she will inform the Holy See about the real possibilities that the monastery has or does not have of guaranteeing initial formation.
",-1
"The formation of the formators and their collaborators is entrusted in part to the monasteries and in part to the Federation, therefore, the President of the Federation is called to strengthen formation at the federal level and to require the participation of those who exercise the service of formation; if this does not happen, she will refer the matter to the Holy See.
",-1
"The President of the Federation, having heard the opinion of the Federal Council, chooses the most appropriate places to hold the specific formative courses for the formators and their collaborators, as well as those who are called to exercise the service of authority, establishing the duration of these courses in such a way that they are not detrimental to the needs of the contemplative life and of the community.
",-1
"Who makes new foundations and why?
",-1
"Throughout the history of the Church, it has been the prerogative of bishops to establish houses of contemplatives in their own dioceses.
",-1
"Now, with the pope having forbidden bishops to exercise this ancient right, according to this document, the federations themselves can make foundations.
",-1
"through the action of the Federation, as established by the Federal Assembly The foundation of a monastery of nuns, keeping in mind what is established in no.
",-1
"39 of the present Instruction, can take place either by a single monastery or, as established by the Federal Assembly [9]
",-1
"A single monastic community that decides to make a foundation, moreover, must be “helped” and guided by the federation:
",-1
"In discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious Assistant intervene to help the Superior of the founding monastery.
",-1
"The discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.
",-1
"Article 39 tells us some criteria for making foundations that “must be considered in their entirety and from an overall perspective.”
",-1
"the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism,” composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, “as long as most are not of advanced age”.
",-1
"a) A community that has given good testimony of fraternal life in common with “” composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, “as long as most are not of advanced age”.
",-1
"b) Besides the number, special skills are required of some nuns of the community who must be able to assume: as Superior, the service of authority; as formator, the initial formation of candidates; as financial administrator, the administration of the goods of the monastery.
",-1
"c) Rooms adapted to the lifestyle of the community, to ensure that the nuns can regularly lead the contemplative life according to the nature and spirit of their Institute.
",-1
"d) Economic conditions that guarantee the community itself can provide for the needs of daily life.
",-1
"One of these things is not like the others.
",-1
"Did you notice?
",-1
"One criterion stands out as indeterminate, vague, compared with the other concrete and measurable standards.
",-1
"One aspect of legislative analysis that I learned early was that the terms used are of utmost importance.
",-1
"If a term is vague or is defined incorrectly that is a “loophole”.
",-1
"Or it could perhaps be described as a handle; a place where a person who wants to effect a particular outcome can grasp a piece of legislation to use it like an axe.
",-1
"So, how, exactly, is it to be determined – and by whom – that a group of nuns possess “the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism”?
",-1
"What, precisely, does the term “vitality” mean and exactly how is one to measure out how much is required?
",-1
"Is this one of Pope Francis little personal, secret expressions of which only he knows the meaning?
",-1
"Like the secret to how nuns are to smile properly?
",-1
"Does the inclusion of completely subjective criteria belong in a juridical document?
",-1
"Or is it in there in order to provide cover for prelates?
",-1
"The next article tells us, “It is the responsibility of the Holy See to evaluate the presence of these requisites.” Do they have an electronic meter in a cupboard in the Congregation for Religious that measures “charism vitality”?
",-1
"It seems important to ask because article 70, on how to suppress a monastery, includes it:
",-1
"Among the criteria that can contribute to determine a judgment concerning the suppression of a monastery, after having examined all the circumstances, the following points should be considered as a whole: the number of nuns, the advanced age of the majority of the members, the real capacity for government and formation, lack of candidates for a number of years, lack of the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism in dynamic fidelity[10].
",-1
"You will be affiliated; resistance is futile…
",-1
"Articles 54-64 offer an interim measure in the case of “incapacity” that is really just more of the second thing.
",-1
"54 Affiliation is a particular form of help that the Holy See establishes in particular situations in favor of the community of a monastery sui juris which has only an asserted autonomy, but in reality, very precarious or, in fact, non-existent.
",-1
"How does affiliation work?
",-1
"Well, the federation and the Holy See between them work it out:
",-1
"In these cases, it is up to the Holy See to evaluate the opportunity of setting up an ad hoc commission formed by the Ordinary, the Federation President, the Federal Assistant, and the Major Superior of the monastery
",-1
"It’s worth remembering what happened in the case of a German men’s monastery in which the superior tried to return the community to pre-Vatican II practices.
",-1
"Mariawald Trappist monastery – 900 years old – was finally dissolved, affiliated to death.
",-1
"Mariawald was consequently affiliated, in the manner this document describes, with a liberal house in the Netherlands whose superior, unsurprisingly, discovered that the house was hopelessly divided and could not be saved.
",-1
"60 The affiliated monastery can accept candidates, but the novitiate and initial formation must be performed in the affiliating monastery or in another monastery established by the Federation.”
",-1
"Of course, this means it is the affiliating monastery’s formation team that would make the determination to dismiss recalcitrant, “neo-pelagian” postulants and novices.
",-1
"~
",-1
"This brings us to about article 155 of the document.
",-1
"Part two to come.
",-1
"_______________
",-1
"[1] It would seem, therefore, that a useful task for someone writing about what this pope intends for nuns would be to read Sponsa Christi Ecclesia as well as Francis’ Apostolic Constitution and make a careful comparison.
",-1
"I’m not going to do that here, but it might be helpful to examine the two documents with the help of a expert at some point.
",-1
"[2] Worth remembering, however, is the fact that it was Benedict the “conservative,” not Francis, who appointed Braz de’ Aviz in the office to replace Cardinal Rode – presumably under that good old “conservative” rubric of the “big umbrella” – under whom these culpably belated attempts to save US religious life were started.
",-1
"[3] Just considering the numbers of course.
",-1
"Leaving alone the doctrinal issues.
",-1
"[4] “The same Institute” means the order in question, whether Benedictine, Dominican, Carmelite etc.
",-1
"[6] “justice and beneficence” are considered on behalf of the community, not the patient
",-1
"[7] Bioethicists take it as read that in order for a life to have sufficient “quality” it must demonstrate sufficient autonomy.
",-1
"[8] Readers may think I’m exaggerating the danger of material motivations for suppressing monasteries, but as we will see, the distinction between the federations and the Holy See is also a matter of paperwork and it is well to recall that the secretary for the Congregation for Religious, Jose Rodrigues Carballo, was a person of interest to international police agencies for the loss of “tens of millions” of Euros from the coffers of the Franciscan Friars Minor, the original Franciscan order of which he had been the head.
",-1
"Shortly after Carballo’s appointment, it was revealed that the Swiss prosecutor’s office was investigating the money missing from the Friars Minor in connection with drugs, money laundering operations and gun running.
",-1
"Carballo was Francis’ very first appointment, April 6, 2013, three weeks after the Conclave and it was to him that the pope gave the task of the destruction of the FFIs, and a major part of that operation was to separate the FFIs from real assets valued at about 30 million Euros.
",-1
"[9] So much for the principle of subsidiarity.
",-1
"I can imagine what a monastery founded by a committee would be like to live in.

"American in China injured in 'sonic attack' similar to Cuba

"© Provided by Al Jazeera Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US was moving medical teams to China over the 'sonic attack' [Leah Millis/ Reuters]
",-1
"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said a brain injury sustained by an American official in a ""sonic attack"" in China was similar to those that affected US and Canadian diplomats in Cuba.
",-1
"Pompeo's remarks on Wednesday came hours after the US embassy in China issued a health warning to Americans living there over an ""unusual"" auditory or sensory phenomena.
",-1
"The embassy said a US government employee in the southern city of Guangzhou reported experiencing a ""subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure"", which led to a mild brain injury.
",-1
"Pompeo told the House Foreign Affairs Committee the ""sonic attack"" in China was similar to the incidents in Cuba last year.
",-1
"""The medical indications are very similar and entirely consistent with the medical indications that have taken place to Americans working in Cuba,"" he said.
",-1
"The US was moving medical teams to the area to work on the case, he said.
",-1
"""We are working to figure out what took place both in Havana and now in China as well,"" Pompeo said.
",-1
"China's foreign ministry did not comment immediately.
",-1
"Heather Nauert, the state department spokeswoman, said the US embassy learned on Friday that the Guangzhou employee showed concussion symptoms after medical testing.
",-1
"That is the same clinical finding doctors treating the Cuba patients at the University of Philadelphia found.
",-1
"The Guangzhou worker started experiencing ""a variety of symptoms"" starting in late 2017 that lasted through April this year, Nauert said.
",-1
"The worker was sent to the US for further evaluation, she added.
",-1
"In Cuba last year, 24 diplomats and their family members were left with mysterious injuries resembling brain trauma, which were suspected of being caused by a ""sonic attack"".
",-1
"Ten Canadian diplomats and their relatives also suffered similar illnesses.
",-1
"The still-unexplained incidents sparked a rift in US-Cuban relations, while investigators have chased theories including a sonic attack, an electromagnetic weapon, or a flawed spying device.
",-1
"Symptoms, sounds and sensations reportedly varied dramatically from person to person, according to The Associated Press.

"Witness: Muslim Democrat IT Aide Awan Wiretapped Her, Then Bank Account She Controlled Was Drained
",-1
"Longtime Geller Report readers have been hearing about this cybersecurity breach by Muslim IT staffers for well over a year.
",-1
"Capitol Police are looking into the massive amounts of data the Awans reportedly downloaded off the congressional system, thousands of illegal logins made on the official system, possible theft of tens of thousands of dollars in congressional equipment and fraud and sent to foreign governments and groups.
",-1
"“Witness Said Awan Wiretapped Her, Then Bank Account She Controlled Was Drained,” by Luke Rosiak, Daily Caller News Foundation, May 21, 2018 (thanks to Todd):
",-1
"The stepmother, Samina Gilani, also previously said Imran stole two laptops from her.
",-1
"Imran, Abid and Jamal Awan — along with Imran’s wife, Hina Alvi, and a friend — worked as IT administrators for 1 out of every 5 House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until police banned them from the network in February 2017for “numerous violations of House security policies.” Months later, none of the family is in jail, and the stepmother and other witnesses have said Imran and Abid have used their freedom to try to steer the outcome of the case since, including by threatening them not to cooperate with authorities, TheDCNF previously reported.
",-1
"In April 2016, the House’s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) detected allegedly falsified purchase orders, and the Inspector General quickly expanded the scope to investigate cyber violations, finding that members of the Awan family improperly accessed congressmen’s servers and the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times.
",-1
"Though House officials suspected that equipment was being stolen, the Capitol Police did not search their homes, The Daily Caller News Foundation learned, and did not ban them from the network until nearly a year later.
",-1
"In the meantime, evidence appears to have been compromised: In December 2016, the CAO notified congressmen that the caucus server had physically disappeared.
",-1
"Though Abid played a prominent role in the late-2016 IG report, he has not been arrested, with congressmen saying a criminal investigation is ongoing.

"In January 2017, in the days around his father’s death, Abid removed Gilani as the beneficiary of his father’s life insurance and replaced her with himself, which led to a lawsuit, TheDCNF previously reported.
",-1
"Abid’s attorney, Jim Bacon, used the life insurance lawsuit to force Gilani to sit for a sworn deposition Oct. 4, 2017 in which he told her to reveal what she told the FBI about the congressional criminal probe and tried to get her to find out details from investigators.
",-1
"In one exchange, Bacon knew that she had emailed with the FBI.

"BACON Q: [redacted] is your email address, isn’t it?

"U.S. warns of 'sonic attacks' in China
",-1
"BEIJING -- The U.S. State Department is warning U.S. citizens in China that a government employee reported unusual ""sensations of sound and pressure"" and was later diagnosed with a mild traumatic brain injury -- a case that recalls a wave of so-called sonic attacks on U.S. diplomats in Cuba.
",-1
"A health alert sent Wednesday said a U.S. government employee assigned to the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou reported ""subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure.""
",-1
"The notification said the department was not aware of any other cases inside or outside the diplomatic community.
",-1
"But signaling the depth of their concern, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and all five U.S. consulates in the country held town hall meetings Wednesday so employees could ask questions and raise concerns.
",-1
"State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said the United States will send a medical team to Guangzhou next week to conduct baseline medical evaluations of all employees who desire one.
",-1
"""The department is taking this incident very seriously and is working to determine the cause and impact of the incident,"" Nauert said.
",-1
"Though the State Department has not linked this case to any other incident, news of unusual symptoms hitting U.S. government employees recalled a rash of incidents with U.S. and Canadian diplomats working in Cuba.
",-1
"The United States last year decided to withdraw a large number of embassy staff from Cuba after diplomats stationed there complained of symptoms such as hearing loss, dizziness, tinnitus, visual difficulties, headaches and fatigue.
",-1
"The American Foreign Service Association said then that government employees had been diagnosed with ""mild traumatic brain injury and permanent hearing loss, with such additional symptoms as loss of balance, severe headaches, cognitive disruption, and brain swelling.""
",-1
"Details about the Guangzhou case are still emerging.
",-1
"Jinnie Lee, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said that from late 2017 to April 2018, a government employee assigned to Guangzhou reported a variety of physical symptoms.
",-1
"The employee was sent to the United States for evaluation and treatment.
",-1
"On May 18, the embassy learned that the diagnosis was mild traumatic brain injury.
",-1
"""The medical indications are very similar, and entirely consistent with, the medical indications that were taking place to Americans working in Cuba,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday during testimony in Congress.
",-1
"""The Chinese government has assured us they are also investigating and taking appropriate measures,"" Lee said.
",-1
"The health alert advised that U.S. citizens in China should consult a medical professional if they experience any symptoms.
",-1
"""While in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source,"" the alert advised.

"A Section on 05/24/2018
",-1
"Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia
",-1
"Saying the shahada makes you a Muslim.
",-1
"The shahada is what is on the black flag of jihad.
",-1
"No non-Muslim student should be forced to write or say the shahada without the qualifier “Muslims believe that…” This is because it is a statement of faith.
",-1
"If the school exercise is requiring students to write it, it should be clear from the wording of the exercise that this is Islamic faith, not the student’s faith.
",-1
"That distinction has been glossed over in many, many school textbook presentations.
",-1
"This is in West Virginia, not Baghdad.
",-1
"Rich Penkoski, the father of a Mountain Ridge student, contacted me and explained the situation further.
",-1
"He sent me the packets the school gave out for the Jewish and the Christian lessons and commented:
",-1
"Notice no bible verses, no reciting the 10 commandments or the Lord’s prayer.
",-1
"No practicing writing in Hebrew (not even the 10 commandments) as compared to the Islamic packet.
",-1
"There are no statements of faith, nothing asking the students to write it or practice in any of the Jewish or Christian rituals.
",-1
"Furthermore the principal of Mountain Ridge Middle School Dr.
",-1
"Branch has used my words against me by saying the teacher did tell the students about the Lord’s prayer (my daughter as well as 1 other said this is false)[.]
",-1
"He is using my arguments I made to him yesterday to protect the teacher.
",-1
"The teacher today told the students the assignment was optional.
",-1
"My daughter as well as other students were under the impression all the packet assignments were mandatory (the Jewish one and the Christian ones were mandatory).
",-1
"I wrote to Dr.
",-1
"Branch to share with him the resource that Miss Hinson used and point out that the material she gave the students did not include all the faith aspects for Christianity.
",-1
"The students received 2 pages for Christianity from this resource while all the Islamic sections were left intact.
",-1
"Here’s the link for you to review.
",-1
"You will notice all the faith elements were left out for Judaism and Christianity while the Islamic section was left the way it’s presented.
",-1
"https://www.gvsd.org/cms/lib/PA01001045/Centricity/Domain/610/World%20Religions.pdf So she decided to use the extra resources for Islam and the school is saying that’s not indoctrination or proselytizing?
",-1
"The faith aspects and the same considerations were not given to the others as they were for Islam.
",-1
"This actually further proves my point that Islam was afforded special privilege over the others.
",-1
"The school is backtracking and being deceptive to try and weasel out of this.
",-1
"The teacher today clarified things for the students but that still does not excuse the fact that they are teaching the Islamic faith and asking the kids to participate in Sharia.
",-1
"Look at the Islamic packet again.
",-1
"They are asking the kids to write the beginning of Surahs.
",-1
"The teacher still has not corrected the error that calligraphy was started by the arabs.
",-1
"They are doubling down and only after being called on it are they trying to backtrack.
",-1
"In Volusia County, Florida, hundreds protested Islamic lessons in their “World History” text, a Common Core-approved high school history textbook.
",-1
"And who is the biggest pusher of Common Core besides leftist progressives?
",-1
"The Islamic Society of North America, a Muslim Brotherhood front group, along with the Hamas-tied Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).
",-1
"In Florida, CAIR is on the offensive (more here).
",-1
"History lessons in Islam are dawah – proselytizing for Islam.

"Large public-school publishers have been bought by the Saudis.

"Unidentified “adult friends.”)

"He sent this message to me:

"Another Sound Weapon Used To ATTACK US Diplomats: This Time In China
",-1
"A United States government employee assigned to the American consulate in Guangzhou, China suffered a mild traumatic brain injury similar to those reported by diplomats in Cuba.
",-1
"The unnamed worker reported, “subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure.”
",-1
"The government employee experienced the symptoms from late 2017 until April of 2018, according to the U.S. State Department.
",-1
"“The employee was sent to the United States for further evaluation.
",-1
"On May 18, 2018, the Embassy learned that the clinical findings of this evaluation matched mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI),” Jinnie Lee, U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Beijing, told Gizmodo by email.
",-1
"“The Chinese government has assured us they are also investigating and taking appropriate measures,” Lee continued.
",-1
"But this isn’t the first time a sound weapon has been used on American diplomats.
",-1
"Cuba has been accused of using a similar device to cause brain trauma in Americans at the embassy in Havana.
",-1
"It all started in the fall of 2016.
",-1
"Several of the affected diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy, which reopened in 2015 as part of Barack Obama’s reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba.
",-1
"The Daily Mail reported that one diplomat described being jolted awake in a Havana hotel room by a grinding, blaring cacophony.
",-1
"When he moved a few feet across the room, the noise stopped.
",-1
"Whether they heard anything or not, the consequences have been unmistakable — symptoms ranging from nosebleeds, nausea, dizziness and severe headaches to mild brain damage and permanent hearing or memory loss.
",-1
"Oddly, as soon as some of the victims left Cuba, they stopped hearing noises.
",-1
"–SHTFPlan
",-1
"The mysterious illnesses reported by U.S. government employees in Cuba are allegedly thought to be either a “sonic attack” or perhaps malfunctioning surveillance gear.
",-1
"It’s not known yet whether the injured government worker in China was targeted with any such device, despite reporting similar symptoms as the diplomats in Cuba.
",-1
"The U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou says that it hasn’t had any other reported cases of strange sounds being heard by American officials, but is taking the issue seriously.
",-1
"“If you have concerns about any symptoms or medical problems that developed during or after a stay in China, consult a medical professional,” the State Department said in a public release.
",-1
"“While in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source.
",-1
"Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present,” the release said.
",-1
"The Cuban government continues to deny they attacked U.S. diplomats with a sonic weapon, and very little additional information is known about those who suffered through the strange ordeal.
",-1
"After months of investigations, U.S. officials concluded that the diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences.
",-1
"It was not immediately clear if the device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack, or had some other purpose.

"The employee was diagnosed with a brain injury.
",-1
"The US Mission in China issued an online health alert on Wednesday saying that the employee ""recently reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure"".

"Reuters contributed to this story.

"TheDCNF had not told anyone other than prosecutors about it.

"But Gowen made copies,” the source, who’s familiar with The Awans, told TheDCNF.

"Awan, three relatives and a friend ran IT for one in five House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until they were banned on Feb. 2, 2017, for “numerous violations of House security policies.” The violations alleged by the House Office of Inspector General include logging into the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times without authorization.

"During Ramadan, Muslims are exhorted to renew and deepen their devotion to Allah.
",-1
"Hence it is a time when they’re supposed to grow more generous and kind toward their fellow Muslims.
",-1
"Ironically, even in doing this he is likely to fail to satisfy Muslims, or anyone.
",-1
"After all, after the Trump White House issued a similar statement last year, the Washington Post ran a lengthy piece in which several Muslims explained why the statement was unsatisfactory to them.
",-1
"Because Trump had the temerity to mention jihad terrorism.
",-1
"Hamid continued: “We, as American Muslims, shouldn’t be defined solely in our relationship to bad things that we have nothing to do with.
",-1
"Meanwhile, it would be dangerous, suicidal folly for Infidels to pretend that Ramadan is not the month of jihad.
",-1
"And as our Ramadan willful blindness continues, more Infidels will die.

"Under the first part of my ongoing analysis of “Cor orans,” a commenter wrote: “When the enemy wants to take a soul, he tries to make it give up prayer.”

"Dom Paul Delatte, OSB, Abbot of Solesmes
",-1
"Today I received an email from a monastery of cloistered Carmelite nuns about the new document from the Vatican’s Congregation for Religious.
",-1
"They’re helping me examine this document, having kindly volunteered to serve as consultants, to help me understand it from an inside position.
",-1
"These, I might add, are not what we would consider a “traditionalist” community.
",-1
"They have only the Novus Ordo Mass and use the new rite Divine Office in their native vernacular language.
",-1
"For obvious reasons I can’t identify them, even to say what country they are in.
",-1
"It signals the end of the contemplative monastic life.
",-1
"Especially for Carmel.”
",-1
"In fact, as the National Catholic Reporter piece said, the meeting itself was “unprecedented,” 1200 formators of religious life gathered by the Congregation for Religious in order to hear the new marching orders.
",-1
"This is the programme:
",-1
"They will not have sense.
",-1
"We need to build, using the Gospel and the Council as a departure point.”
",-1
"After breathing this threat, the cardinal continued, saying that because modern people’s “needs” are fundamentally different from what they were in the past, there was no reason to stick too closely to what the founders and foundresses – people like St. Anthony, St. Augustine, St. John Cassian, St. Benedict, St. Bruno, St. Dominic, Sts.
",-1
"Francis and Clare, Sts.
",-1
"Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross - wanted.
",-1
"“These contexts have changed.
",-1
"And the council reminds us that consecrated life must be Christian discipleship ... must be discipleship of the founders that we remember, but also must be open to the culture of the present moment.”
",-1
"“We must not be closed to new things.
",-1
"God is not static,” the cardinal said.
",-1
"“God is always new movement – of light, of heat, of demonstration.
",-1
"He speaks in every time to men and women with the true language of that time.”
",-1
"The congregation’s Secretary, Archbishop José Rodríguez Carballo, is reported as saying, “With this explicit reference to the Second Vatican Council, we point to our profound conviction that the council is the point of reference, non-negotiable, in the formation to the consecrated life.”
",-1
"Not the charism of the order, nor the rule, nor the Patristic tradition, nor the Doctors, nor the mystics, nor any of the 2000-year-old tradition of religious life, from the Desert Fathers to the giants of the Tridentine period; just Vatican II.
",-1
"Carballo continues his remarks, giving us a clue as to his feelings towards strictly cloistered, contemplative religious life: “A consecrated life, a life in God but inserted in the ecclesial family, in the church – inserted in the world.
",-1
"Not in conflict with the world, but inserted in continuity,” he said.
",-1
"It is to wonder what this man would make of a comment by the great Dom Paul Delatte, the second abbot of Solesmes and successor to the refounder, Dom Gueranger, who wrote in his commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict:
",-1
"“After entering into Christ by baptism and by the monastic profession, we should hold ourselves as far aloof from the world as possible and have no connection with it.
",-1
"There shall no longer be more intercourse between us than there is between two corpses: ‘The world is crucified to me and I to the world.’
",-1
"“Let us be on our guard against thinking that it may sometimes be proper to soften the differences, to lessen the distance which separates us.
",-1
"The Apostle warns us that we can only please God by preserving the integrity of our true life: ‘No man being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses: that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.’ The world itself is scandalised by our condescending to it, and the words of the Imitation [of Christ] are always fulfilled: ‘Sometimes we think to please others by our company; whereas we begin rather to be displeasing to them by reason of the bad qualities they discover in us.’”
",-1
"How Cor orans will end St. Teresa of Avila’s reform of Carmel
",-1
"Sister T. continued, saying that the document explicitly derogates the founding intentions of St. Teresa for whom real autonomy was a crucial element of her Carmelite reform.
",-1
"She acknowledges that cloistered orders of nuns have for some time been gathered into federations.
",-1
"These are already doing the Cor orans programme, having shared initial formation programmes for postulants and novices, “ongoing formation” courses for professed nuns, a federal abbess or president who oversees all the federated monasteries.
",-1
"Their funds are already interconnected and they have regular meetings with and input from the male branches.
",-1
"In 2015, Carmelite monasteries received a questionnaire from the Father General Fr.
",-1
"Saverio Cannistra, a Mexican and devotee of Liberation Theology, to ask if they wanted an International Commission of Nuns to oversee the female houses place of the Carmelite Fathers.
",-1
"This suggestion was rejected, to the annoyance of Maccise.
",-1
"Maccise also promoted the idea of having no superiors in the individual monasteries, but only federation presidents and shared formation of novices.
",-1
"The push for these changes is still on, however, under the current General, an Italian, Saverio Cannistrà.
",-1
"Given the Marxist leanings of the recent crop of Fathers General, it seems clear that what can be expected by “ongoing formation” is, in essence, some form of political indoctrination, sprayed over with a micro-thin layer of pious language.
",-1
"But for Carmelite nuns, Sister said, these ideas are the antithesis of the intentions of St. Teresa.
",-1
"Authentic autonomy, independence of formation and finances, “are essential points of our charism that Our Holy Mother established and to do away with them is to do away with the charism.”
",-1
"“They go against our Constitutions, even though Cor Orans states that everything is to be done in accord with the charism and Constitutions.
",-1
"Each Carmel has its own spirit, its own tempo, it’s own ‘feel.’ Each nun is called not just to the Order, but to a specific Carmel.
",-1
"Formation in common is something we’ve been fighting against for years.”
",-1
"St. Teresa specifically set up the monasteries so that none of this would take place.
",-1
"And now it’s going to be done to us.”
",-1
"“As though the Church is going to ask laypeople to be engaged for nine years before they marry.
",-1
"Our Constitutions already provide a three year extension of temporary vows if needed, but to make it mandatory will dissuade women from entering.
",-1
"It will also help the monastery become ‘less viable’ because by the time anyone younger is professed, the others will be dead.”
",-1
"Another requirement will be for a “religious assistant,” a priest monitoring the monastery in addition to a chaplain, to be assigned by the federation.
",-1
"Sister writes that this was rejected “years ago” by Carmelite monasteries as undue interference.
",-1
"Article 23 states, for instance, “In discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious assistant intervene to help the superior of the founding monastery.
",-1
"The discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.”
",-1
"There are no options in this document, no choices, no recourse.
",-1
"It’s all being done to us.
",-1
"In this day and age, when Pope Francis is proclaiming, if not Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, then at least license and ‘choice’ for all, plus the ‘rights’ of women, here our rights are completely taken away.”
",-1
"Another nun has written saying that they cannot conceive of what these people mean by “ongoing formation”.
",-1
"Judging from other documents from already-federated Carmelites in Europe, it means in practical terms going in groups away from the monastery for days or weeks at a time to take “courses” together with novices from other monasteries.
",-1
"The content of these course, of course, is to be formulated by teams of “experts” chosen by the Federation.
",-1
"Sister writes, “Cloistered nuns have a very full horarium that does not allow for a lot of other things.
",-1
"Can they not comprehend that simply faithfully living our daily life provides plenty of on-going formation.”
",-1
"Apparently not.
",-1
"As I wrote in my first analysis piece, the document itself – that we must remember is a piece of legislation, a legal document laying out what all monasteries of contemplative nuns must now do – starts by laying out its working premise:
",-1
"Pope Francis, in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II, intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades, in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio-cultural conditions.
",-1
"Anyone who imagines that this document’s authors will allow leeway, that there will be dispensations forthcoming for traditional or “conservative” communities from timid and cowed Vatican bodies like Ecclesia Dei, has failed to pay attention.
",-1
"They point to the Nashville Dominicans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Poor Clares of Alabama, where there are at least habits, (some) chant, common life and common apostolates.
",-1
"In the continuing analysis that will follow this article, we can see that the purpose of this document is to fulfill the totalitarian fantasies of the anti-Catholic revolutionaries, now nearing the end of their lives 50 years after their initial near-triumph.
",-1
"Its intention is mopping up; either to herd the remaining recalcitrants – those who have resisted even to the softened and conciliating degrees typical of “conservatives” – into the full post-conciliar “reform” instituted by the revolutionaries in the 1960s – or to close them.
",-1
"The thing is, the result will obviously be the same either way.
",-1
"The whole world has seen what happens to religious life that takes on the VaticanTwoist New Paradigm.
",-1
"I have just received a document that was issued privately summarising the findings of a meeting of federated Discalced Carmelite nuns in Europe in 2009.

"The report shows average ages of nuns between 65 and 80, “infirmary Carmels,” nuns in state nursing homes, entire communities living in care facilities and half the Carmels with no one in formation.
",-1
"Solutions offered are equally uniform: heaped-up bureaucracy, common formation courses between monasteries developed by “religious psychologists,” ever more powers handed to federations.
",-1
"This is federated Carmelite monastic life under Pope Francis’ New Paradigm of fully implemented VaticanTwoism.
",-1
"Very little is said of any efforts being made to increase vocational outreach using the internet or through diocesan contacts.
",-1
"Indeed, in one case in Spain, the sisters themselves advocate abandoning traditional Teresian autonomy altogether.
",-1
"The report from Great Britain notes: “18 Carmels have closed in the last 40 years.
",-1
"There have been two amalgamations in recent years and another one involving three Carmels is in process.
",-1
"Two communities at present are living together in one monastery as a temporary measure.”
",-1
"Only one fully autonomous functioning Carmel still exists in the Netherlands, and the remains of four entire communities are living in a single care home run by religious brothers.
",-1
"But in this situation, the “solution” undertaken has been an elaborate bureaucratic reshuffle, including gaining approval from Rome, for “a completely new structure,” whose main task, no doubt, will be the making of funeral arrangements and disposing of library books.
",-1
"The atmosphere is weirdly resigned – one federation report recommended simply “forgetting the numbers” – with many notes of mutual congratulation over “unity,” the creating of “links” and the “building of trust” and “dialogue” between communities.
",-1
"The report from Belgium – federated in 1997, average age 73 with one sister in formation for 11 monasteries – states tersely that their biggest problem is “ageing” but under “possible solutions” says only, “We want to continue along the path we have begun.”
",-1
"It is only in the report from Croatia where the problem changes abruptly from aging nuns and no vocations to too many vocations with not enough room[2].
",-1
"It is also notable that it is only in the Croatian report that Christ gets a direct mention.
",-1
"Federation of Croatia & Bosnia-Herzegovina: 82 nuns in 5 convents, with an average age of 47, and eleven in formation.
",-1
"This outlier differs from the Western European federations in several respects, notably that it was only federated in 2002.
",-1
"But the effects of the federating/formation courses are already being felt: “Nowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.”
",-1
"Path taken: Have made a foundation in Albania; however this community is not federated.
",-1
"From the beginning, our Association has organized formation courses for the younger sisters as well as courses of permanent formation.
",-1
"Each year, we have one or two seminars, which are also the occasion to the meeting of the Council of the Association.
",-1
"The duration is 3 to 4 days and they take place every time in a different Monastery of the Association.
",-1
"We invite the sisters of other Carmelite convents friends to our formation courses: sisters from Albania, Slovenia and Bulgaria.
",-1
"Present Problems: In general, in our Association the vocations continue growing, but there are differences between the monasteries.
",-1
"Nowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.
",-1
"Possible solutions: We do all what is in our hands in the area of the vocational promotion, collaborating in this way with Christ who calls by his Spirit.
",-1
"These self-generated reports were made in response to a questionnaire set out for the meeting.
",-1
"All speak of nothing but bureaucratic responses: shared “formation courses,” meetings of superiors, amalgamations and suppression of houses and finally “care homes” and houses given over entirely as infirmaries.

"The strangest report came from the Netherlands where, for a single surviving autonomous monastery and an average age of 81, resources were mobilised to create “a completely new structure,” complete with approval from the Congregation for Religious:
",-1
"Federation: Netherlands

",-1
"Solemnly professed: 73
",-1
"In formation: ....
",-1
"Average age: 81 [NB, the bold was in the original.]
",-1
"What has been done: 13 Dutch Carmels and one in Iceland have united in a Federation.
",-1
"This has created a close communion from the beginning.
",-1
"Everyone has collaborated in the process of amalgamations and suppressions.
",-1
"Present Problems: Only one Carmel functions fully autonomously in the Netherlands.
",-1
"4 communities are in a care-home run by the Brothers of the Immaculate Conception.
",-1
"Another Carmel was renewed in 1990.
",-1
"At the original Carmel an infirmary wing has been added for those sisters who require nursing; it is run by Franciscan sisters.
",-1
"With the passing of time the Assembly of the Federation has transferred tasks to the President of the Federation, according to the faculties described in the statutes, in particular regarding our mutual solidarity.
",-1
"Also, with the passing of the years, the Congregation for Religious has placed responsibility directly into the hands of the Council of the Federation.
",-1
"Finally, the autonomous Carmels have asked help from the Federation in order to protect their interests.
",-1
"Due to our very advanced age in the Netherlands we have reached the moment when a General Assembly is no longer possible.
",-1
"We are left with the problem that in the communities there are no sisters who can or who want to be prioresses or council sisters.
",-1
"The structure of the Federation that we have had till now is thus no longer possible.
",-1
"Possible solutions: The Federation Council, the Religious Assistant, together with a canon lawyer of the Dutch Conference of Religious, have worked hard on a completely new structure, in which in its first draft the autonomy of the Carmel has been constantly kept in mind.
",-1
"We began from three points:
",-1
"1)Maintenance of the formal autonomy of the Carmels that still exist, but with the chance to transfer tasks gradually to the council of the Federation.
",-1
"2)Appointment of The Federal board or Federal Council of the Federation, preferably appointed by the Superior General.
",-1
"The team will consist of a president and vice-president who are members of one of the convents, appointed to functions, and of three people who are members, or not, of one of the convents.
",-1
"3)A Supervisory council, also to be appointed periodically by the Superior General, which will be made up of three members, whose president will be, preferably, a member of a religious institute, preferably of the Carmelite Order and appointed to functions.
",-1
"This council sees itself as a supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the Assembly of the Federation.
",-1
"In October 2008, the President, the Religious Assistant and a Lawyer were in Rome where they explained the proposals.
",-1
"They had meetings with Fr.
",-1
"General and with the Congregation for Religious.
",-1
"These were open meetings that helped us to clarify matters.
",-1
"An important concern was that they would allow us to use lay people on the Federal Council of the Federation and the Supervisory council.
",-1
"We were aware that we were not dealing with a simple matter, but we think that, in view of our present situation today, we do not have much choice.
",-1
"It is important to continue to protect the interests of our Federation in the most responsible and careful way, so that all the sisters, even those advanced in years, can continue to live their life in Carmel.
",-1
"Definitive permission came at the 25th of February.
",-1
"Sr. Enrica Rosanna, the representative of the Vatican’s Congregation for Religious told them that the “two great challenges to our contemplative life” are “the challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy.” She warned the nuns against bringing vocations from other countries to keep their monasteries alive, dropping a hint about what now seems to be a particular obsession of the Congregation.
",-1
"Cor orans would take this subject up definitively in 2018:
",-1
"The nuns were exhorted to “stay awake to welcome the dawn” of a bright new future:
",-1
"“These are difficult and uncertain times, but it is also the time to stay awake as the new dawn is already announcing itself.” “Our aim must be to be open to the future.
",-1
"We should not forget that we are following in the tradition of Teresa of Jesus and in the tradition of all those who have followed in her footsteps.
",-1
"It is a wide road that opens up before us.
",-1
"We must be women of hope and faith.
",-1
"We must always believe that God is the one who directs history.
",-1
"From this derives our task, to be creative and, at the same time, faithful (creative fidelity).” [emphasis in the original.]
",-1
"Instead, Sr. Enrica, after this bizarre and cryptic comment, spoke of the “problems and difficulties that we can encounter” in discernment of mostly non-existent vocations, including “consumerism, modern means of communication, difficulties in creating a stable personality, autonomy of the young, the need to be always supported, the ideology of subjectivism.”
",-1
"What are these people smoking?
",-1
"Given that this was three years or more from the abdication of Benedict and the installation of the New Paradigm of Francis/Kasper, one wonders what this “new dawn” was actually about.
",-1
"Was Sr. Enrica somehow anticipating the fulfillment of those hippie-era dreams in the years to come?
",-1
"It is certainly clear from Francis’ first acts as pope that he had dealing with conservative and Traditionalist nuns high on his list of priorities.
",-1
"His first appointment, no more than three weeks after the Conclave was Jose Rodrigues Carballo, the Religious Congregation’s Secretary and – given the scandal that erupted on his leaving them – the financial wrecking ball of the Franciscan Friars Minor.
",-1
"Certainly this record of the European Carmelites’ meeting is jammed with hints that Cor orans was on the way.
",-1
"On the final day of the meeting, the “theme for the day” was offered by then-Father General Luis Arostegui: “Government: the need for change.
",-1
"Autonomy and Association; autonomy and Fr.
",-1
"General; other solutions to government.”
",-1
"The devolution of authority of superiors of individual monasteries to federations was obviously on someone’s mind, as was a plan to see to it that monasteries change superiors frequently: “Essential autonomy can fail due to the relationships within the community: abuses by permanent superiors who decide on the freedom and decisions of the community,” the Father General warned.
",-1
"And there were certainly hints that a general re-organisation of structures of authority was in the works.
",-1
"A common tactic of politicians who want to initiate changes is to “ask questions” rather than make suggestions, and Arostegui asked some very leading questions indeed in this closing address:
",-1
"“Who discerns the existence or not of vital autonomy; is it the community or chosen people?
",-1
"“Are there instances that work well within the Church which balance autonomy in a way that can be helpful in these situations?
",-1
"“At the time of St. Teresa she was an example of someone balanced.
",-1
"Stability is one reason [for autonomy], but is stability understood in such a way that it can obstruct the spirit of mission and your availability to the Order and to the Church?
",-1
"“The valiant and prophetic initiative of Pope Pius XII to create Associations and Federations opened up contemplative life, though it was also thought that it could harm cloister and autonomy.
",-1
"Can such essential autonomy continue as it is?
",-1
"“50 years ago there was stability.
",-1
"How do we conceive today the relationship between autonomy and Federation-Association and between autonomy and Fr.
",-1
"General?
",-1
"“Could there be other forms of government?”
",-1
"Following the Father General’s address are notes from the language groups, including the following:
",-1
"“While some communities do not want their autonomy to be touched, and have certain fears of ‘external’ interference, others want a more moderate and flexible autonomy that, without going to the Congregation would have a juridical form, where the President with her Council can intervene in extreme cases that today we watch with pain, our hands tied.
",-1
"Though we want these legal channels to be established, it must remain clear what the limits of the Federation Council are, in order to avoid abuses of power on the part of the same.” “...The absence of vital autonomy is also noticed when… the same person remains prioress for years.” “...We need criteria that expand number 203 of our Constitutions and clarify vital autonomy.
",-1
"We perceive that there is a shortage of authority figures.
",-1
"We do not want new figures but rather those that already exist (Associations, [federation] Presidents, Provincials...) be empowered in a legal way (canonically) to help communities in difficulty, for the mission to discern, to counsel, to accompany.” “...We are also concerned for those communities not affiliated to Federations, we see that we should be close to them.”
",-1
"Maybe this summary document of 2009 can give us an idea what to expect from Rome in 2018, now that the “progressivist” faction in the Vatican is in the ascendancy and is free to act without restriction.
",-1
"What comes clear comparing this document to Cor orans is that the Vatican’s machinery has long been at work forcing a uniform and essentially bureaucratic, heavily authoritarian and legalistic vision of contemplative life on anyone who fails sufficiently to resist it.
",-1
"And with the statistics offered at this meeting we can see clearly where this road leads.
",-1
"But this report of 2009 shows a clear picture of a Roman congregation determined to see the revolution through to its inevitable conclusion.

"Isidore D’Silva had prepared a booklet with the liturgy for each day.

"Even when government schools are not intentionally promoting cultural Marxism or other left-wing ideologies, they are still implicitly biased toward big government.

"Ex-Navy sailor pardoned by Trump says he's suing Comey and Obama
",-1
"A former Navy sailor who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials, alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law.
",-1
"Specifically, Kristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, argues that the same officials who meted out punishment to him for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and handling of classified information.
",-1
"His lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others.
",-1
"“They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,” Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, “but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton.
",-1
"Hillary is still walking free.
",-1
"Two guys on my ship did the same thing and weren’t treated as criminals.
",-1
"We want them to correct the wrong.”
",-1
"Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December.
",-1
"There is usually a six-month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed.
",-1
"“We’ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted,” Daigle said.
",-1
"“We’re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there’s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.”
",-1
"While campaigning, and after taking office, Trump frequently voiced support for Saucier, who in March became the second person he pardoned.
",-1
"Trump often compared the Obama administration’s handling of Saucier’s case with that of Clinton.
",-1
"Saucier, who lives in Vermont, pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009.
",-1
"He said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine's propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera.
",-1
"Saucier said that he recognized he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked.
",-1
"But he lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton's emails.
",-1
"“My case was usually something handled by military courts,” he said.
",-1
"Saucier, 31, said that the pardon has enabled him to pick up the pieces and rebuild his life with his wife and young daughter.
",-1
"A felony conviction left him scrambling to find work; he finally landed a job collecting garbage.
",-1
"Now, he works on design and engineering projects for an industrial boiler company.
",-1
"“Things are starting to go in the right direction,” Saucier said.
",-1
"“I work with a group of really great people, I get to use my skills set.”
",-1
"Because of the loss of income during his imprisonment, as well as earning below his potential when he collected garbage, he and his wife Sadie lost their home to foreclosure.
",-1
"Debt collectors called and his cars were repossessed.
",-1
"“With a pardon there’s no magic wand that that gets waved and makes everything right,” he said, “But I try to stay positive and look forward.”
",-1
"He praises the pardons that Trump has granted, and takes exception at the criticism.
",-1
"“The Obama administration singled out Dinesh for things most people don’t even get charged for,” Saucier said.
",-1
"“President Trump noticed that my career was exemplary and that I didn’t deserve what happened to me.
",-1
"Conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who was pardoned by Trump last week, had pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud.
",-1
"Trump tweeted Thursday: ""Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D'Souza today.
",-1
"D'Souza was sentenced in 2014 to five years of probation after he pleaded guilty to violating federal election law by making illegal contributions to a U.S. Senate campaign in the names of others.

",-1
"""The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.""

"Ex-Speaker Boehner should probably re-check the old party's pulse, for the Bush-Boehner GOP may not just be napping.

"Consider.
",-1
"That GOP set out to create a new world order where dictatorships were threatened with ""regime change,"" and democratic capitalism was the new order of the ages.

"Yet, Donald Trump captured the Republican nomination and won the presidency—by saying goodbye to all that.
",-1
"How probable is it that a future GOP presidential candidate will revive the Bush-Boehner agenda the party rejected in 2016, run on it, win, and impose it on the party and nation?
",-1
"A brief history: In seven elections starting in 1992, Republicans won the presidency three times, but the popular vote only once, in 2004, when George W. was still basking in his ""Mission Accomplished"" in Iraq.
",-1
"What fractured and overwhelmed the Bush-Boehner Republican Party?
",-1
"First, demography.
",-1
"The mass immigration of Third World peoples that began with the 1965 immigration act, and the decline in the birth rate of native-born Americans, began to swamp the Nixon-Reagan New Majority.
",-1
"Between 1997 and 2017, the EU ran up, at America's expense, trade surpluses in goods in excess of $2 trillion, while we also picked up the bill for Europe's defense.
",-1
"In Trump's first year, China's trade surplus with the United States hit $375 billion.
",-1
"From January to March of this year, our trade deficit with China was running at close to the same astronomical rate.
",-1
"""Trade deficits do not matter,"" we hear from the economists.
",-1
"They might explain that to Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.

"And perhaps someone can explain the wisdom of handing 4 percent of our GDP each year to an adversary nation, as U.S. admirals talk tough about confronting that adversary nation over islets and reefs in the South China Sea.

"Ex-Sailor Pardoned By Trump Says He’s SUING Obama And Comey
",-1
"A former Navy sailor, who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump, is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials.
",-1
"Kristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, says he was subject to unequal protection of the law.
",-1
"Saucier said that he realizes he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked.
",-1
"He has also lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton’s emails.
",-1
"According to Fox News, Saucier argues that the same officials who sought out punishment to Saucier for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and mishandling of classified information.
",-1
"Saucier’s lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others.
",-1
"He said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine’s propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera.
",-1
"–Fox News
",-1
"We want them to correct the wrong.” Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December.
",-1
"There is usually a six-month period that must elapse before the lawsuit actually is actually filed.
",-1
"“They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton,” he continued, alleging his life was ruined for political reasons.
",-1
"“With a pardon, there’s no magic wand that gets waved and makes everything right,” Saucier said, “But I try to stay positive and look forward.” Saucier has had cars repossessed and is in debt due to the loss of income after having a felony on his record.

",-1
"The same FBI that gave Hillary Clinton a pass for operating an illegal email server, which we have evidence for the fact that she sent and received classified documents through resulting in a national security breach and at least one death, but would not give the same leniency to Saucier who simply took some pictures of his submarine.
",-1
"Fox News reports:
",-1
"Saucier's attorneys attempted to use the Hillary Clinton defense to get him out of hot water for taking pictures of classified systems aboard the USS Alexandria in 2009.
",-1
"Prosecutors sloughed off the defense, saying it was essentially “grasping at highly imaginative and speculative straws in trying to further draw a comparison to the matter of Secretary Hillary Clinton based upon virtually no understanding and knowledge of the facts involved, the information at issue, not to mention any issues if intent and knowledge.”
",-1
"Saucier confessed to taking photos of the submarine back in 2009 when he served as a 22-year-old machinist mate, saying he wanted to show the pictures to his family and future children.
",-1
"Following an interview with the FBI in 2012, he destroyed all evidence of the pictures, meaning the Naval Criminal Investigative Service could not confirm his claims that he did not share the photos with unauthorized people.
",-1
"We don’t believe this was really his true character.”

"“My case was usually something handled by military courts,” Saucier said.

",-1
"December marked the fifth month in a row in which the immigrant working-age population ( legal and illegal declined from the same month of the prior year.
",-1
"Simultaneously, immigrant displacement of American workers fell, also apparently confirming a trend that began in September.
",-1
"And, by the way, black unemployment is at a record low.
",-1
"According to the Labor Department employment report released last Friday, December there were 77,000 fewer working-age immigrants (legal and illegal) in the country in December 2017 than in December 2016—a decline of 0.18%.
",-1
"This follows year-over-year drops of 138,000 in August, 143,000 in September, and 117,000 in October, and 64,000 in November.
",-1
"Not since the Great Recession has the foreign-born working-age population declined for five consecutive months—but now, in telling contrast, the economy is expanding.
",-1
"Note that this is a net figure.
",-1
"The year-over- year reduction in the immigrant working-age population does not mean new immigrants have stopped coming in.

"Immigrant Population Hit Record 43.7 Million in 2016, By Steven A. Camarota and Karen Zeigler,October 16, 2017] So the 77,000 reduction in working-age immigrants from December 2016 to December 2017 is consistent with a gross inflow of about 500,000 new foreign-born workers (legal and illegal) over that period—the gross inflow more than offset by the gross reduction of 600,000 due to deaths, deportations, and immigrant emigrants.
",-1
"This helps explain why a reduction in the immigrant workforce population reduction is compatible with reports of a recent increase in illegal immigration on the U.S. southwest border (albeit still less than at the end of the Obama Regime).
",-1
"The additional good news: Native-born American workers took all the jobs created this month, according to the Household Survey, which records workers’ immigrant status (but not their legal status).

"The ""other"" employment survey, of households rather than businesses, also broadcast mixed signals—at least so far as the prospects for native-born workers are concerned.

"In May, according to the Household Survey, total employment rose by 105,000.

"This Hispanic/non-Hispanic divide was, of course, a convenient proxy for VDARE.com's primary interest: foreign-born workers and their role in displacing their native-born counterparts.

"Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall
",-1
"A new Senate report reveals that Barack Obama secretly paved the way for Iran to tap into U.S. banks to convert cash it received from sanctions’ relief to dollars — despite the face the White House assured lawmakers it would do no such thing.
",-1
"The report shows how State Department and Treasury Deparment officials during the Obama era quietly gave a special license for a major Omani bank to do business with two U.S. banks.
",-1
"This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
",-1
"The U.S. banks were pressured into complying with the deal.
",-1
"The Washington Times has more:
",-1
"A copy of the report, obtained by The Washington Times, outlines how Obama-era State and Treasury Department officials discreetly issued a special license for the conversion to a major Omani bank and unsuccessfully pressured two U.S. banks to partake in the transaction, all while misleading lawmakers about the activities.
",-1
"She also called on foreign governments to harden their financial systems against “deceptive” Iranian transactions that ultimately channel money to terrorists.
",-1
"The Iranian government “uses shell and front companies to conceal its tracks” as part of an elaborate scheme designed to procure cash for the Quds Force of Iran’s militant Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, Ms. Mandelker said.
",-1
"Iranian officials said the increase, while provocative, does not violate its commitments under the nuclear accord.
",-1
"He made the comment a day after Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered the increase in capacity and vowed that Iran would preserve its nuclear program despite the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 accord.
",-1
"The Senate report focuses new scrutiny on the lengths President Obama’s team was willing to go to ensure the deal’s success as it was still being negotiated.
",-1
"The Senate Homeland Security Committee’s permanent subcommittee on investigations probe contends that the Obama administration went out of its way to keep U.S. lawmakers in the dark about calculated and secretive efforts to give Tehran a back channel to the international financial system and to U.S. banks, facilitating a massive U.S. currency conversion worth billions of dollars.
",-1
"“Senior U.S. government officials repeatedly testified to Congress that Iranian access to the U.S. financial system was not on the table or part of any deal,” according to a draft copy of the document obtained by The Times.
",-1
"“Despite these claims, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, at the direction of the U.S. State Department, granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system.
",-1
"“Even after the specific license was issued, U.S. government officials maintained in congressional testimony that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system,” the report said.
",-1
"Sen.
",-1
"Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, is set to outline his panel’s findings Wednesday.
",-1
"Under terms of the nuclear deal, Iran was given the right to reclaim billions of dollars in state assets and bank accounts frozen by international sanctions, but it remained “illegal for U.S. persons, entities, and financial institutions to do business with Iran or parties on behalf of Iran.”
",-1
"The ban included any “intermediary” transactions by U.S. banks to convert currency for Iran — a development that would have elevated the value of the Iranian assets on the global market and allowed Tehran to more easily move the money through the international banking system.
",-1
"On the day the nuclear deal was implemented in 2015, Tehran had some $5.7 billion worth of assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat, Oman, according to Senate investigators, who said Tehran moved quickly to request access to the U.S. dollar.
",-1
"On Tehran’s request, Bank Muscat contacted the U.S. Treasury Department’s office of foreign assets control.
",-1
"According to the Senate report: “Muscat sought to convert $5.7 billion in Omai rials into euros.
",-1
"[But] because the rial is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the most efficient conversion was with an intermediary step through a U.S. bank using U.S. dollars.”
",-1
"Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2015 that Iran would “continue to be denied access to the [U.S.] financial and commercial market” under the proposed accord, but the Treasury office went ahead with attempts to quietly allow the currency transaction sought by Iran.
",-1
"“On February 24, 2016, OFAC issued a specific license to Bank Muscat authorizing Iranian assets worth roughly $5.7 billion to flow through the U.S. financial system,” according to the Senate report, which claims the move was made “even though U.S. sanctions prohibited it.”
",-1
"Even as office of foreign assets control officials directly “encouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds,” the Treasury Department continued to deny it was working to facilitate the currency transaction, said the report, which cites a 2016 letter from the department to Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, and Sen. Mark Kirk, Illinois Republican, that contended the Obama “administration has not been and is not planning to grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system.”
",-1
"The catch, according to Senate investigators, was that neither of the U.S. banks approached by the office of foreign assets control would take on the Iranian currency exchange — in part because of political concerns over the prospect of being found out to have secretly circumvented the remaining ban on U.S. transactions with the Islamic republic.
",-1
"Despite the Obama administration’s efforts, Iran was ultimately forced to convert its Bank Muscat assets to euros in small increments using European banks and without accessing the U.S. financial system, the Senate investigators said.
",-1
"“Despite claims both before and after the Iran deal was completed that the U.S. financial system would remain off limits, the Obama administration issued a specific license allowing Iran to convert billions of dollars in assets using the U.S. financial system,” Mr. Portman said.
",-1
"“The only reason this transaction wasn’t executed was because two U.S. banks refused, even though the administration asked them to help convert the money.”
",-1
"Such sanctions, he added, “are a vital foreign policy tool, and the U.S. government should never work to actively undermine their enforcement or effectiveness.”

"Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused
",-1
"International financial institutions get a lot of heat for terror state ties.
",-1
"But this is a case where Obama Inc. tried to get them to do the wrong thing.
",-1
"While they did the right thing.
",-1
"The Obama administration secretly sought to give Iran access — albeit briefly — to the U.S. financial system by sidestepping sanctions kept in place after the 2015 nuclear deal, despite repeatedly telling Congress and the public it had no plans to do so.
",-1
"And that's part of why Spygate is happening.
",-1
"The assault is also a cover-up.
",-1
"The report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations revealed that under President Barack Obama, the Treasury Department issued a license in February 2016, never previously disclosed, that would have allowed Iran to convert $5.7 billion it held at a bank in Oman from Omani rials into euros by exchanging them first into U.S. dollars.
",-1
"If the Omani bank had allowed the exchange without such a license, it would have violated sanctions that bar Iran from transactions that touch the U.S. financial system.
",-1
"The effort was unsuccessful because American banks — themselves afraid of running afoul of U.S. sanctions — declined to participate.
",-1
"The Obama administration approached two U.S. banks to facilitate the conversion, the report said, but both refused, citing the reputational risk of doing business with or for Iran.
",-1
"The banking system was more reluctant to help Iran launder money than he was.
",-1
"Nor was Obama worried about the reputational risk of loading foreign currency on unmarked cargo planes and flying it to Iran.
",-1
"Issuing the license was not illegal.
",-1
"Still, it went above and beyond what the Obama administration was required to do under the terms of the nuclear agreement.
",-1
"Except Obama Inc. weren't trying to drive a hard bargain.
",-1
"So they didn't stick to it.
",-1
"They were trying to aid Iran.
",-1
"Obama administration officials at the time assured concerned lawmakers that a general license wouldn’t be coming.
",-1
"But the report from the Republican members of the Senate panel showed that a draft of the license was indeed prepared, though it was never published.
",-1
"And when questioned by lawmakers about the possibility of granting Iran any kind of access to the U.S. financial system, Obama-era officials never volunteered that the specific license for Bank Muscat in Oman had been issued two months earlier.
",-1
"Not a one.

"GOP report: Obama admin worked to allow Iran to exchange billions to bypass sanctions
",-1
"Washington (CNN) Senate Republicans on Wednesday accused the Obama Administration of secretly trying to give Tehran access to the US financial system to convert billions of dollars in assets into Euros as part of the Iran nuclear deal.
",-1
"A report released by Republican senators on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation said the Obama administration didn't tell Congress that it sought access for Iran and, in its eagerness to clinch the nuclear deal, was trying to dodge sanctions that remained in place following the 2016 agreement.
",-1
"Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee and opposed the Iran deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
",-1
"The accusations were rejected by Obama administration officials who said Republicans are trying to make a one-time effort to meet obligations under the nuclear deal sound like an attempt to give Iran broad access to the US financial system.
",-1
"They said the Republican senators never interviewed former Obama administration officials involved, and noted that no Democrats were involved.
",-1
"Iran deal reverberations
",-1
"The report and the former officials' response highlight how controversial the Iran deal continues to be, even after President Donald Trump's May 8 decision to leave the international pact.
",-1
"That move continues to roil relations with European allies who are sticking with the Iran deal.
",-1
"They appealed to the US on Wednesday to exempt them from sanctions as they continue to do business with Tehran.
",-1
"But one goal behind report's release, according to an official familiar with its contents, is to make clear that the US is not likely to be open to exemptions of any kind.
",-1
"""As the United States begins to re-impose sanctions on Iran and Iranian entities, our European allies must understand and appreciate that doing business with Iran is no longer permissible,"" the source said.
",-1
"The report focuses on $5.7 billion from Iranian oil sales that were frozen in Oman's Bank Muscat in that country's currency, the rial.
",-1
"Rials are pegged to the US dollar and are difficult to convert.
",-1
"But as part of the nuclear deal, Iran was promised access to overseas reserves of its own funds that had been frozen by sanctions.
",-1
"To access the rials, Iran wanted to convert them briefly into dollars and then Euros.

"The majority report by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation says that the US Treasury, at the instruction of the US State Department, granted a license to convert the $5.7 billion briefly into American dollars so it could be converted into euros.
",-1
"The exchange was legal, the report notes.
",-1
"Officials at Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control asked two US banks to work as intermediaries and execute the transaction, but they declined, citing concern over potential regulatory backlash and a ding to their reputations.

",-1
"A legal transaction
",-1
"But in the end, Treasury officials concluded that the transaction was legal.
",-1
"The report said they decided that the terms of the JCPOA were ""consistent with Iran's position, allowing the Government of Iran to engage in 'transfers,' 'foreign exchange (including Rial related transactions),' and the 'purchase or acquisition by the Government of Iran of US bank notes.'""
",-1
"The source familiar with the report said that Congress asked the Obama administration directly about such a license, but that the administration was under no legal obligation to provide the licenses to Congress.
",-1
"The Republican report argues that in pushing for the license to go forward, Obama officials were violating financial and oil-related sanctions imposed on Iran stemming from the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and trying to give Iran access to the US financial system.
",-1
"They pointed to a number of Obama officials, including Lew, who said in congressional testimony that Iran was not granted access to the US financial system.
",-1
"Lew said in 2015 that Iran ""will continue to be denied access to the [US's] financial and commercial market.""

"Former head of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is on the front line of aiding and abetting Awan and his associates as has been revealed by Luke Rosiak of The Daily Caller.
",-1
"In a lengthy report by Rosiak at The Daily Caller News Foundation, he writes:
",-1
"Ex-Democratic National Committee head Debbie Wasserman Schultz said she intervened in a Pakistani land deal involving her then–IT aide Imran Awan, according to two House employees.
",-1
"The dispute came after Awan’s father was charged with fraud in relation to the deal, and the mysterious exertion of political influence resulted in Pakistani authorities instead targeting the elderly alleged victims, according to a local report.
",-1
"The congresswoman also told Kiko she had invited Awan’s whole family to her daughter’s bat mitzvah and said she had “helped him with a land deal,” the sources said.
",-1
"A spokesman for Kiko declined to comment on this story.
",-1
"Awan’s father purchased “huge chunks of land from different farmers in 2008,” but all the checks bounced, the report said.
",-1
"“About a dozen farmers of Chak 7-JB, Panjor, including five siblings — all aged between 57 and 70 — have given up hope of justice after they sold their agricultural lands to Ashraf Awan of Bole De Jhugi, who is father of White House employee Shahid Imran,” Dawn reported.
",-1
"Imran Awan also goes by Shahid Imran Awan, Virginia court records show.
",-1
"The police harassed the 19 would-be victims, including the five elderly brothers and even their lawyer, and charged them with “frivolous” cases, apparently to get them to stop trying to get the money they say they were owed, the paper said.
",-1
"A third source, who’s familiar with Imran Awan, told TheDCNF that Awan recounted the intervention in the foreign criminal matter and that Awan said it was Wasserman Schultz who intervened.
",-1
"A fourth source — a fellow House IT aide — previously told TheDCNF that Awan said now-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel wasinvolved.
",-1
"Dr. Zafar Iqbal, one of the alleged victims, told TheDCNF that “Imran came to Pakistan to get [his father] out of jail, since he had some [connections] in the Congress.”
",-1
"On July 25, 2016, the House Inspector General notified the Committee on House Administration that investigators had detected major cybersecurity violations by the Awan family.
",-1
"Awan, his wife, two brothers, his brother’s wife, and even his elderly father were all being paid by various Democrats to manage their servers, with many of the members from Wasserman Schultz’s Florida.
",-1
"The finding came at a critical time for Democrats: It was three days after WikiLeaks published the first emails from a hacked on the DNC, setting the stage for Wasserman Schultz to lose her position as party chair and for Democrats to begin electioneering on a theme of Russian hacking.
",-1
"In February 2017, Kiko and the House’s top law enforcement official, Paul Irving, outlined serious violations in a letter to the committee, and the family was banned from the House computer network.
",-1
"The letter also noted that the House Democratic Caucus server disappeared soon after the IG report named it as key evidence.
",-1
"But Wasserman Schultz refused to fire Awan, with her spokesman saying he would work on “websites” and “printers,” which a cybersecurity expert previously told TheDCNF would presumably involve network access.
",-1
"The congresswoman also added Awan’s wife, Hina Alvi, to her payroll in late 2016, after the investigation was in full swing, but before the family was banned from the network.
",-1
"Wasserman Schultz kept paying her until March 17 — 12 days after Alvi went to Pakistan with $12,000 in a suitcase.
",-1
"The story also said Wasserman Schultz had a “friendly personal relationship” with Awan and Alvi.
",-1
"Fleet did not respond to a request for comment.
",-1
"“Termination, now it’s the member’s responsibility … We can revoke everything but they could still be employed,” he said.
",-1
"Wasserman Schultz became fixated on finding out everything investigators knew about Awan, the House sources said.
",-1
"House investigators briefed her extensively with significant evidence about Awan and his family, including improper computer evidence.
",-1
"Yet Wasserman Schultz said in a statement, “my office was provided no evidence to indicate that laws had been broken, which over time, raised troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling.”
",-1
"Despite Wasserman Schultz’s relationship with Awan, in April 2017 — two months after he was banned from the computer network — the IT aide appeared to put the congresswoman at risk.
",-1
"Capitol Police found a laptop with the username RepDWS in a phone booth at midnight along with a copy of Awan’s ID, a letter to prosecutors and a note that said “attorney client privilege,” according to a police report.
",-1
"Awan’s ID caused police to tie it to a criminal suspect and seize it, but the note kept them from looking at it.
",-1
"That led to a tense exchange recorded on video in May 2017, in which Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the Capitol Police with “consequences” for not returning the laptop.
",-1
"When he refused, she mulled attempting to restructuring the Capitol Police’s entire board so that her committee would have more leverage over it.
",-1
"Wasserman Schultz hired the House’s former top lawyer, Bill Pittard — who had recently quit the House — to try to block prosecutors from seeing evidence, TheDCNF previously reported.Awan obtained legal representation from two lawyers who began their careers in Miami — one with experience in espionage cases and the other a former aide to Hillary Clinton.
",-1
"Wasserman Schultz’ district includes much of Miami.
",-1
"One of Awan’s lawyers told a judge he felt “very strongly” that prosecutors should not be able to look at the RepDWS laptop, mounting an attorney-client privilege argument.
",-1
"Prosecutors did not challenge the argument before the judge.
",-1
"In August 2017, Imran and Hina were charged with four felony counts for gathering up money under allegedly false circumstances before wiring $300,000 to Pakistan in January.
",-1
"Prosecutors said the timing suggests that the Awans had learned of their investigation, which a spokeswoman for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, AshLee Strong, told TheDCNF was supposed to be secret.
",-1
"Capitol Police “requested that the shared employees be allowed to continue to use their IT credentials until February [2017] because they didn’t want to tip off the employees,” she said.

"Wasserman Schultz’s brother is a prosecutor in the same office handling the case and has tweeted about it.

"Now consider this: even though, as President of the United States, Barack Obama had access to information that the general public does not have, and certainly knew of Iran’s involvement in the 9/11 attacks, Obama still pursued the Iran nuclear deal and gave billions to the Islamic Republic.

"“Iran Admits To Facilitating 9/11 Terror Attacks,” by Adam Kredo, Washington Free Beacon, June 8, 2018:
",-1
"Iranian officials, in a first, have admitted to facilitating the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. by secretly aiding the free travel of al Qaeda operatives who eventually went on to fly commercial airliners into the Twin Towers in New York City, according to new remarks from a senior Iranian official.
",-1
"Mohammad-Javad Larijani, an international affairs assistant in the Iran’s judiciary, disclosed in Farsi-language remarks broadcast on Iran’s state-controlled television that Iranian intelligence officials secretly helped provide the al Qaeda attackers with passage and gave them refuge in the Islamic Republic, according to an English translation published by Al Arabiya.
",-1
"“Our government agreed not to stamp the passports of some of them because they were on transit flights for two hours, and they were resuming their flights without having their passports stamped.

"However their movements were under the complete supervision of the Iranian intelligence,” Larijani was quoted as saying.
",-1
"The remarks represent the first time senior Iranian officials have publicly admitted to aiding al Qaeda and playing a direct role in facilitating the 9/11 attacks.
",-1
"The U.S. government has long accused Iran of playing a role in the attacks and even fined the Islamic Republic billions as a result.
",-1
"The U.S. 9/11 Commission assembled to investigate the attacks concluded that Iran played a role in facilitating the al Qaeda terrorists.

"John Pilger: I have never known anything like it.
",-1
"Julian has been vindicated in every possible way and yet he is isolated as few people are these days.
",-1
"He is cut off from the very tools of his trade, visitors aren’t allowed.
",-1
"I was in London recently and I couldn’t see him, although I spoke to people who had seen him.
",-1
"But really it comes down to the British government.
",-1
"Although he is still in a foreign embassy and actually has Ecuadorian nationality, his right of passage out of that embassy should be guaranteed by the British government.
",-1
"The United Nations Working Party on Unlawful Detentions has made that clear.
",-1
"It is very good that you are doing this, Dennis, because even in the media outside the mainstream, there is this silence about Julian.

"Number one is justice.

"Instead, I understand the indictment they are trying to concoct reads like a charge of espionage!

"This is a terrible time for journalism.
",-1
"JP: You are absolutely right: It is a terrible time for journalism.
",-1
"That said, it is not new.
",-1
"There has always been a so-called mainstream which really comes down to great power in media.
",-1
"It has always existed, particularly in the United States.

",-1
"Ray is a former member of the CIA but extremely principled.

"There was something highly emblematic about that for me.

"He stood up to challenge the fact that the CIA was about to hand over leadership to a person who had been in charge of torture.
",-1
"DB: There has certainly been a lot of collusion when it comes to Israel.
",-1
"Then the word “collusion” is quite appropriate.
",-1
"JP:That’s the ultimate collusion.
",-1
"In the media these were described as “clashes.” Although they did become so bad that The New York Times in a later edition changed its front page headline to say that Israel was actually killing people.
",-1
"A rare moment, indeed, when the immunity, the collusion was interrupted.
",-1
"Where does he come into the picture?
",-1
"JP:I think it comes down to information.
",-1
"If you go back to when WikiLeaks started, when Julian was sitting in his hotel room in Paris beginning to put the whole thing together, one of the first things he wrote was that there is a morality in transparency, that we have a right to know what those who wish to control our lives are doing in secret.
",-1
"The right to know what governments are doing in our name—on our behalf or to our detriment—is our moral right.
",-1
"Julian feels very passionately about this.
",-1
"There were times when he could have compromised slightly in order to possibly help his situation.
",-1
"I was reading just the other day a 2006 WikiLeaks cable from the U.S. embassy in Caracas which was addressed to other agencies in the region.

",-1
"It detailed how subversion should work.
",-1
"I was reading this official document thinking how the information contained in it was worth years of the kind of distorted reporting from Venezuela.
",-1
"It also reminds us that so-called “meddling” by Russia in the U.S. is just nonsense.
",-1
"The word “meddling” doesn’t apply to the kind of action implied in this document.

"It is intervention in another country’s affairs.

",-1
"It has given people the information they have a right to have.
",-1
"They had a right to find out from the so-called “War Logs” the criminality of our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
",-1
"That’s when, on Clinton’s watch, we learned that the NSA was gathering personal information on members of the United Nations Security Council, including their credit card numbers.
",-1
"You can see why Julian made enemies.

"FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist
",-1
"Department of Justice Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz has released his 500 plus-page report, which purports to shine a light on the mishandling at top levels of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation of the 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State under former President Obama.
",-1
"Such mishandling included violations of Department of Justice standards and FBI protocols.
",-1
"The report from the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) criticized certain actions and decisions of former FBI Director James Comey, together with those of other senior FBI officials who were involved in the probe, including former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe.
",-1
"Mr. McCabe is already the subject of an earlier criminal referral from the OIG for his alleged unauthorized leaks to the media and lying to federal investigators about his media contacts.
",-1
"Mr. Horowitz’s report focused on process and procedures.
",-1
"The inspector general made clear when he launched his investigation in January 2017 that “his review will not substitute the OIG's judgment for the judgments made by the FBI or the Department regarding the substantive merits of investigative or prosecutive decisions.""
",-1
"To be sure, the report faulted Comey for deviating from FBI and Justice Department procedures in handling the probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State, thereby negatively impacting “the perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice.” Comey, according to the OIG report, “engaged in ad hoc decision making based on his personal views even if it meant rejecting longstanding Department policy or practice.”
",-1
"He “upset the well-established separation between investigative and prosecutorial functions,” the report said.
",-1
"Comey’s follow-up letters to Congress on October 28 and November 6, 2016 were similarly criticized.
",-1
"The first letter informed Congress that agents were reopening their probe into Clinton’s handling of classified material after discovering her e-mails on the laptop of Andrew Weiner, the husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.
",-1
"This letter was followed on November 6, 2016 by Comey’s statement that the review of the additional information had been completed and that the FBI remained convinced that charges were not appropriate.
",-1
"Comey acted against the advice of senior Justice Department officials in making these disclosures the way he did.
",-1
"The OIG report was highly critical of the FBI’s failure to take immediate action on the Weiner laptop when they first learned about it in late September 2016, rather than waiting another month so close to the election.
",-1
"The criticisms of Comey's undisciplined behavior was all well and good, but it was reasonable to expect something more than the equivalent of a departmental employee review after nearly a year and a half of investigation.
",-1
"Hillary Clinton’s supporters will no doubt jump on the inspector general’s criticisms of Comey’s handling of the July 5th announcement and subsequent letters as proof that he improperly influenced the outcome of the election in President Trump’s favor, even if he did not do so deliberately for political reasons.
",-1
"However, what Comey really did was to give Hillary Clinton a Get Out of Jail Free card.
",-1
"The fix was in as early as May 2016, well before the FBI interviews of Hillary Clinton and of as many as 17 other key witnesses, when Comey began the process of drafting an exoneration memo.
",-1
"Indeed, Comey admitted in his book that “we started the Clinton investigation aware that it was unlikely to be a case that career prosecutors at the Department of Justice would prosecute.”
",-1
"Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were involved in the edits.
",-1
"Mr. Horowitz’s report thus concluded, “We did not identify evidence of bias or improper considerations.” This conclusion defies common sense.
",-1
"Clinton was fully aware of what she was doing when she set up the private server arrangement in the first place and knowingly used it to send and receive e-mails involving official government business, which by their very nature would be expected to include classified information.
",-1
"It turns out that some of the e-mails were accessed by foreign parties.
",-1
"Hillary lied repeatedly when she first denied there were any classified e-mails on her system and then described some of the e-mails involved in the investigation as having been classified after the fact.
",-1
"As Comey has admitted, several e-mail chains concerned matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received by Clinton.
",-1
"Yet Mr. Horowitz saw no reason to doubt the sincerity of Comey's explanations for giving Hillary a free pass.
",-1
"Incredibly, however, Mr. Horowitz’s report “found no persuasive evidence… that the outcome of the investigation would have been different had Clinton been subpoenaed before the grand jury.”
",-1
"Mr. Horowitz also did not deem Comey’s possible perjury in his testimony before Congress to be an appropriate subject for criminal referral.
",-1
"Comey testified that his decision to exonerate Hillary was not made before her interview took place, when for all intents and purposes it was.
",-1
"Mr. Horowitz simply took Comey’s word for what he had meant.
",-1
"Inspector General Horowitz again emphasized form and process over substance in finding a “troubling lack of any direct, substantive communication” between Comey and Attorney General Lynch ahead of Comey’s July 5 press conference on Clinton and his October 28 letter to Congress.
",-1
"As to the substance of Ms. Lynch’s decision to meet with Bill Clinton at all before his wife’s FBI interview, all Mr. Horowitz’s report had to say was that it was “an error in judgment.”
",-1
"Trump is “not ever going to become president, right?
",-1
"Right?
",-1
"!” Page texted Strzok.
",-1
"“No.
",-1
"No he’s not.
",-1
"We’ll stop it,” Strzok responded.
",-1
"Mr. Horowitz wrote that this exchange was “not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate’s electoral prospects.” The inspector general questioned whether Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia collusion investigation over following up on the Clinton e-mail-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias.
",-1
"Strzok should have been subject to a criminal referral for arguably violating 18 U.S.C.
",-1
"§ 595, enacted as part of the original 1939 Hatch Act, prohibiting any public officer or employee, in connection with an activity financed wholly or in part by the United States, from using his or her official authority to interfere with or affect the nomination or election of a candidate for federal office including the president of the United States.
",-1
"The punishment for violation is a fine, imprisonment for not more than one year or both.
",-1
"Instead, Strzok's punishment will most likely be limited to disciplinary action and possibly dismissal.
",-1
"Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch… Plus A Whole Lot More!
",-1
"At the end of the day, Horowitz was unable to find solid proof that the agency acted in a politically partisan and biased manner in the Clinton email case.
",-1
"While the report refuses to say conclusively that political bias was the animus behind the FBI’s handling of the Clinton probe, it also indicates that IG Horowitz may have more to say about the FBI’s political leanings in his Russia report.
",-1
"The Washington Post explains:
",-1
"“[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right?
",-1
"!” the lawyer, Lisa Page, wrote to Strzok.
",-1
"No he won’t.
",-1
"We’ll stop it,” Strzok responded…
",-1
"The messages “potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,” the inspector general wrote…
",-1
"Strzok has argued that he was just trying to reassure Page that Trump couldn’t win, and that he wasn’t implying that they would take action to stop his election.
",-1
"Page and Strzok are not the only FBI officials assigned to the Clinton email probe who were found to have exchanged personal messages indicating either an animus against Trump or frustration with the fact that the FBI was investigating Clinton.
",-1
"The report identified five officials with some connection to the email probe who were expressing political views, faulting them for having brought “discredit to themselves, sowed doubt about the FBI’s handling of the midyear investigation, and impacted the reputation of the FBI.” The midyear investigation refers to the Clinton email probe.
",-1
"“The messages cast a cloud over the FBI investigations to which these employees were assigned,” Horowitz alleged.
",-1
"“Ultimately the consequences of these actions impact not only the senders of these messages but also other who worked on these investigation and, indeed, the entire FBI.”
",-1
"By no later than September 29, the inspector general alleged, the bureau had learned “virtually every fact” it would cite as justification late the next month to search Weiner’s laptop for messages of Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin.
",-1
"The report also faulted the bureau for assigning essentially the same personnel to the Russia and Clinton teams, and singled out Strzok, suggesting his anti-Trump views might have played a role in his not acting more expeditiously on the new lead.
",-1
"Did you get that?
",-1
"IG Horowitz can’t prove it, but he’s not sure that Strzok wasn’t acting in a politically biased manner when he slow-played the Clinton investigation while moving more quickly on the Russia investigation.
",-1
"We see this kind of corruption all over the world, why should believe that these officials could be immune to acting on their personal biases?
",-1
"There were 7 of them on the case, and they were comfortable enough with each other to express their biases openly and none of them ever chastised the others for expressing those biases!
",-1
"Not only that, the team that handled Clinton’s investigation so poorly was almost the identical team that was then assigned to handle the Russia investigation!
",-1
"Meaning, the obviously politically biased team that had just cleared the woman that they supported, was now tapped to investigate if the man that they hated was tied to Russian corruption.
",-1
"Not only was he slow-playing the Clinton investigation, he may be the only reason she was never charged with a crime.
",-1
"In a newly released FBI email, we learned that “foreign actors” gained at least some access to Hillary Clinton’s unsecure email system.
",-1
"Fox News obtained the memo prepared by the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, which lays out key interim findings ahead of next week’s hearing with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz.
",-1
"The IG, separately, is expected to release his highly anticipated report on the Clinton email case later Thursday.
",-1
"The House committees, which conducted a joint probe into decisions made by the DOJ in 2016 and 2017, addressed a range of issues in their memo including Clinton’s email security.
",-1
"“Documents provided to the Committees show foreign actors obtained access to some of Mrs. Clinton’s emails — including at least one email classified ‘Secret,'” the memo says, adding that foreign actors also accessed the private accounts of some Clinton staffers.
",-1
"Here’s the email in question:
",-1
"Peter Strzok email about Clinton emails by Fox News on Scribd
",-1
"At HotAir.com John Sexton explains the importance of this discovery:
",-1
"In the FBI memo, you can already see the genesis of the distinction the FBI would rely on to clear Clinton.
",-1
"Strzok writes that the media has been focused on the question of why Hillary seems to be getting a pass when “Petraeus/Berger/Libby” did not.
",-1
"He writes, “We draw the distinction in noting we have no evidence classified information was ever shared with an unauthorized party, i.e.
",-1
"notwithstanding the server setup, we have not seen classified information shared with a member of the media, an agent of a foreign power, a lover, etc.” In other words, Hillary may have been hacked but she didn’t intentionally give anything away.
",-1
"Of course, the statute itself didn’t make intent a prerequisite.
",-1
"Herridge reports that the House committee memo once again raises this same issue: “Officials from both agencies have created a perception they misinterpreted the Espionage Act by stating Secretary Clinton lacked the requisite ‘intent’ for charges to be filed,” the memo says, before pointing to statements by Comey that indicated a belief that intent was required — which the memo says ignored “meaningful aspects” of the law.
",-1
"It really does seem that Strzok, an agent who had a personal pro-Hillary bias, was the person who pushed to let her off the hook by focusing on her intent rather than her negligence setting up the server in the first place.
",-1
"However, I also think that the IG has purposely left room in his conclusion to amend that decision after he’s concluded his Russia investigation.
",-1
"In fact, there are already signs of him doing that in this report.
",-1
"Much of the information that he uses to chastise Strzok’s behavior and judgment in the Clinton email case, would have actually come from his current investigation into the Russia mess.
",-1
"We’ll see.

"With What the Qur’an Meant: And Why It Matters, religion author Garry Wills is here to reassure us:

",-1
"Not a thing (p. 7).
",-1
"That would be good to know, were Wills a reliable witness.

"Unfortunately, he proves to be just the opposite: Wills laments “Robert Spencer of Jihad Watch calling for a ban on the Qur’an” (p. 58).

",-1
"By adding “at the shrine” to this verse, Wills restricts the call to fight to the area around the Sacred Mosque in Mecca.

"To eradicate these, Muslims are required to wage war until there exists none of it in the world, and the only religion is that of Allah.

",-1
"Because these stipulations are found in the Qur’an, they cannot be questioned or set aside.

"At the 2018 AMA Annual Meeting, delegates adopted policy for the AMA to support: Establishing laws allowing family members, intimate partners, household members and law enforcement personnel to petition a court for the removal of a firearm when there is a high or imminent risk for violence.
",-1
"Prohibiting persons who are under domestic violence restraining orders, convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes or stalking from possessing or purchasing firearms.

"Encourage the development of curricula and training for physicians with a focus on suicide risk assessment and prevention as well as lethal means safety counseling.

"Newly adopted policy also means the AMA will:

"Advocate for schools to remain gun-free zones except for school-sanctioned activities and professional law enforcement officials.
",-1
"Oppose requirements or incentives of teachers to carry weapons.
",-1
"I also oppose it because it's just another step for the federal government to say they need a database so states can check, thus identifying gun owners and possibly their weapons.

"Stop Comparing Immigration Enforcement to the Holocaust
",-1
"The media has 2 very simple rules for Holocaust analogies.
",-1
"The Muslim Brotherhood's leaders praising Hitler, calling for another Holocaust and killing Jews is nothing like the Holocaust.
",-1
"And only shameless Zionists would attempt to equate killing Jews with killing Jews.

"Anything a Republican president does is exactly like the Holocaust.

"Then Hayden doubled down on that analogy.

"Repeatedly.

"But instead it seems to have whetted his appetite for making them.
",-1
"That's the really relevant part.

"Just about every country splits up families when they arrest the parents.

"US Conference of Mayors Call For More Gun Confiscation Legislation
",-1
"According to the mayors:
",-1
"Strengthening the Regulation of Gun Sales and Dealers, including: Limiting the number of guns a person may purchase in a single transaction or in a month or other specified period of time;
",-1
"Banning replica handguns;
",-1
"Increasing inspections of licensed gun dealers; and
",-1
"Targeting and holding responsible gun dealers who break the law by knowingly selling guns to straw purchasers; Banning Assault Weapons and Large-Capacity Magazines, including: Reinstating a strengthened, effective ban on military-style assault weapons, such as AK-47s, and their component parts; and
",-1
"Banning large capacity ammunition feeding devices and the importation of all large capacity ammunition clips.
",-1
"Supporting Local Efforts to Reduce and Combat Gun Crimes, including: Opposing concealed carry reciprocity policies and legislation that would circumvent city policies established to protect residents;
",-1
"Providing local governments and law enforcement officials access to ATF gun trace data;
",-1
"Opposing ""Stand Your Ground"" or ""Shoot First"" laws and urging state legislatures that have adopted such laws to repeal them; and
",-1
"Encouraging mayors to take executive actions to combat gun violence and illegal use and trafficking of guns; Protecting Young People, including: Opposing proposals to allow teachers and other non-law enforcement, non-security personnel to carry firearms in K-12 schools;
",-1
"Raising the youth handgun ban from 18 to 21 years of age;
",-1
"Banning juvenile possession of semiautomatic assault rifles; and Holding gun owners criminally liable when children gain access to improperly stored guns.
",-1
"Protecting Domestic Violence Victims, including:
",-1
"Prohibiting persons convicted of domestic violence crimes or subject to final domestic violence restraining orders from acquiring or possessing firearms; and
",-1
"Requiring prohibited domestic abusers to turn in firearms they already own;
",-1
"How does any of this stop gun violence?
",-1
"It doesn't.
",-1
"Banning semi-automatic weapons doesn't stop crime either, as we've pointed out before, and the statistics are available for anyone to see that gun violence didn't go down one bit during the decade of the Clinton/Feinstein assault weapons ban.
",-1
"Again, this will do nothing to stop criminals with guns.
",-1
"On top of that, the criminal mayors want to institute red flag laws.
",-1
"""The U.S. Conference of Mayors registers its strong support for extreme risk protection order laws and urges both states and the federal government to enact such laws,"" the group wrote.
",-1
"Guns.com reported on some of the statements made by some of these mayors.
",-1
"Karen Freeman-Wilson, mayor of Gary, Indiana and chairwoman of the conference’s criminal and social justice committee, said gun-related tragedies “rips families and communities apart.” “Policies like background checks on all gun sales and Red Flag Laws save lives.
",-1
"It’s as simple as that,” Freeman-Wilson said.
",-1
"“Our bipartisan network of mayors knows how to work together and compromise on policies that save lives.
",-1
"If only our partners in Congress did the same.” Gun control groups, including Everytown for Gun Safety and Mayors Against Illegal Guns, praised the conference for reaffirming its support for stricter regulations.
",-1
"None of these statements can be backed up by facts.

"If you buy into this, you probably think places like Chicago, Illinois are among the safest places to live in the US when the opposite is true.

"'Textbook Definition of Bias'
",-1
"On Monday, DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified with FBI boss Christopher Wray before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
",-1
"In a predictable performance, the duo cited mistakes and raised concerns but solved none of the lingering mysteries the massive report released last week that found anti-Trump bias did not affect FBI and DOJ decisions.
",-1
"On Tuesday Horowitz performed solo before a joint session of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees.
",-1
"Oversight chairman Trey Gowdy delivered the opening statement.
",-1
"The attorney general had been accused of “softening or watering down his report,” Gowdy said, “When the reality is it was Jim Comey who softened and watered down his press release, announcing no charges against Secretary Clinton.
",-1
"Republicans sought to tie up some loose threads.
",-1
"The IG report confirmed that President Obama communicated with Hillary Clinton on her unsecured email system.
",-1
"Horowitz said the president had been one of 13 who had done so.
",-1
"Rep. Steve King asked about the volume of communications between the president and Clinton.
",-1
"“I’ll have to get back to you on that,” Horowitz said, and the IG was “not sure” if any of the communications had involved classified or top secret material.
",-1
"If the IG did know the subject of the president’s communications with Clinton, he failed to reveal any details.
",-1
"Horowitz “would have to ask” if his team interviewed any officials at the Obama White House but said “not the president himself.”
",-1
"Horowitz found that Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and James Comey were all involved.
",-1
"As for the question of her “intent,” Horowitz said it arose “months earlier,” maybe in 2015, though he couldn’t be sure.
",-1
"King said President Obama had suggested the “careless but not intentional” language in a “60 Minutes” appearance in October of 2015.
",-1
"And King had observed that in his July 5, 2016 statement, James Comey used “intent” six times.
",-1
"Horowitz said Comey “concealed from the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, his intention to make a unilateral announcement in July 2016 about the reasons for his recommendations not to prosecute former Secretary Clinton.” The IG also described his report as a “thorough, comprehensive and objective recitation of the facts.”
",-1
"The IG did confirm that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page worked on the Clinton investigation, the Russia and the Mueller team.
",-1
"Horowitz said Strzok and Page had exchanged “tens of thousands of texts.” Ohio Rep. James Jordan asked Horowitz when his team had discovered the message about “we’ll stop” Trump.
",-1
"Horowitz conceded that this meant “stop Trump from becoming president.” The IG said they uncovered that text in May, and Jordan asked “why did we not see it until last Thursday?”
",-1
"“I can’t answer that,” Horowitz said, adding that it had been sent to Rod Rosenstein’s department at the DOJ.
",-1
"Jordan concluded that Rosenstein “made the decision that we had to wait a month.”
",-1
"Several representatives were curious about two FBI agents and one lawyer the IG report had not named.
",-1
"“The FBI raised a concern because they work on counterintelligence matters,” Horowitz said.
",-1
"Rep Mark Meadows asked if the two FBI agents were Kevin Clinesmith and Sally Moyer, which the IG declined to confirm.
",-1
"“They don’t work in counterintelligence,” said Meadows, who charged that the FBI gave the IG “false information” and altered key witness reports.
",-1
"“How did Comey see the report before it came out?” Rep. Darrell Issa wanted to know.
",-1
"Horowitz said Comey didn’t see the whole thing, but explained that he allowed those the IG team had criticized to have a look before release.
",-1
"By the end of the day it was evident that Congress would have to hear from Comey, Rosenstein, Strzok and others.
",-1
"Horowitz confirmed that the IG is investigating whether FBI official Peter Strzok’s anti-Trump bias factored into the launch of the bureau’s Russia probe.
",-1
"Also on Tuesday Peter Strzok was “escorted” from the FBI building.
",-1
"As his lawyer told reporters, Strzok had “played by the rules,” but been targeted by “unfounded personal attacks, political games and inappropriate information leaks.”
",-1
"“I hope he comes and portrays himself as a victim,” Trey Gowdy told Fox News.
",-1
"Rep. Bob Goodlatte said the committee would issue a subpoena for Strzok to testify “next week.”
",-1
"During World War II Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty was a huge critic of fascism and wound up in prison.
",-1
"In Oct. 1945 he became head of the Church in Hungary and spoke out just as strongly against Communist oppression.
",-1
"He wound up back in prison for eight more years, including long periods of solitary confinement and endured other forms of torture.
",-1
"Two weeks after the trial began in early 1949, Pope Pius XII (having failed to speak out forcefully against the Third Reich) did summon the courage to condemn what was happening to Mindszenty.
",-1
"Pius excommunicated everyone involved in the Mindszenty trial.
",-1
"When the Hungarian revolution broke out in 1956, Mindszenty was freed, but only for four days.

"In 2010, while he was still a free man, the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity gave its annual award to Assange.
",-1
"The citation read:
",-1
"The First Amendment, approved four years later, aimed at ensuring that the press would be free of government interference.
",-1
"That was then.
",-1
"It has been said: “You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.” WikiLeaks is helping make that possible by publishing documents that do not lie.
",-1
"Last spring, when we chose WikiLeaks and Julian Assange for this award, Julian said he would accept only “on behalf or our sources, without which WikiLeaks’ contributions are of no significance.” We do not know if Pvt.
",-1
"We hope to have a chance to honor them in person in the future.
",-1
"Today we honor WikiLeaks, and one of its leaders, Julian Assange, for their ingenuity in creating a new highway by which important documentary evidence can make its way, quickly and confidentially, through the ether and into our in-boxes.
",-1
"Eventually a compromise was found in 1971 when Pope Paul VI lifted the excommunications and Mindszenty was able to leave the U.S. embassy.

"The Obama Era Jade Helm Connection To The Current Illegal Immigration Policy
",-1
"On the surface, the latest illegal immigration debate between Leftists and the Administration looks like, yet another issue Progressives are trying to undermine progress being done by the president.
",-1
"No one should be surprised by the crackdown on illegals entering the country, especially since it was one of the major campaign promises Donald Trump made before getting elected.
",-1
"When it comes to the separation of children from their families, there is nothing new today that was not being done during the Obama reign.
",-1
"In 2013, Obama began bringing into the US literally over a hundred thousand people, mainly below age 21.
",-1
"They were bused, flown, and met at the US border with Mexico by the Department of Homeland Security under the direction of Obama to do so.
",-1
"Since most of them were adolescents and older teenagers they could not be set free, thus Obama ordered various military bases to house these children.
",-1
"The surge of children into the US from various countries south of the border was said to be the result of economics, high crime rates, and actual threats from organized crime entities.
",-1
"We have only what little information the government told us then, which was not very much, considering the fact that Obama wanted to keep as much of this situation as secret as possible.
",-1
"Many remember the military taking over several Walmart locations, mainly in Texas, during the Jade Helm exercises.
",-1
"This, along with the federal government grab of millions of acres of land during the Obama years, speaks volumes in the government's plan to be able to handle millions of people.
",-1
"Since Obama planned to have over a million Muslim refugees brought into the US over a short period of time, along with the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants coming in, one can understand the reason the Feds had to have the Walmart stores and so much land, as they needed housing for the millions they planned to bring in.
",-1
"Despite President Trump signing an Executive Order suspending Syrian refugees from entering the US for 120 days on Jan. 26, 2017 while security measures were reviewed, the US still imported 110,000 refugees from Syria and various other countries into the US in 2017 alone, up from 85,000 the previous year.
",-1
"These numbers follow Obama's projections of the expected amount of refugees permitted to come to the US.
",-1
"Of course, as with the number of illegal immigrants entering our county, the Feds downplay the actual number which always ends up to be more than quadruple their stated number.
",-1
"What they do not want to admit to is the fact that today's illegal immigration picture is one that follows the Obama plan on dealing with the influx of illegals to a carbon copy.
",-1
"The bottom line is, both the Left and the Trump Administration seem to be following along with a plan of action going back to Jade Helm which paved the way for the housing needed for such a huge influx of illegal immigrants and refugees.
",-1
"All of which seems to be a planned event.
",-1
"In any case, neither side in DC is really interested in solving the illegal immigration problem or cares about the children involved.

"A secret memo marked “URGENT” detailed how the House Democratic Caucus’s server went “missing” soon after it became evidence in a cybersecurity probe.
",-1
"The secret memo also said more than “40 House offices may have been victims of IT security violations.”
",-1
"In the memo, Congress’s top law enforcement official, Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving, along with Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko, wrote, “We have concluded that the employees [Democratic systems administrator Imran Awan and his family] are an ongoing and serious risk to the House of Representatives, possibly threatening the integrity of our information systems and thereby members’ capacity to serve constituents.”
",-1
"The memo, addressed to the Committee on House Administration (CHA) and dated Feb. 3, 2017, was recently reviewed and transcribed by The Daily Caller News Foundation.
",-1
"The letter bolsters TheDCNF’s previous reporting about the missing server and evidence of fraud on Capitol Hill.
",-1
"It details how the caucus server, run by then-caucus Chairman Rep. Xavier Becerra, was secretly copied by authorities after the House Inspector General (IG) identified suspicious activity on it, but the Awans’ physical access was not blocked.
",-1
"But after, the report reads, the server appears to have been secretly replaced with one that looked similar.
",-1
"The memo called for firing the Pakistani-born aides, revoking all their computer accounts, and changing the locks on any door they had access to.
",-1
"Rep. Louie Gohmert — a Texas Republican on the House Committee on the Judiciary who has done oversight work on the case — said the missing server contained copies of Congress members’ emails.
",-1
"“They put 40 members of Congress’s data on one server … That server, with that serial number, has disappeared,” he said.
",-1
"Multiple sources connected to the investigation told TheDCNF that shortly after an IG report came out identifying the House Democratic Caucus server as key evidence in a criminal probe, the evidence was stolen.
",-1
"“They [the Awans] deliberately turned over a fake server” to falsify evidence, one official close to the CHA alleged.
",-1
"“It was a breach.
",-1
"The data was completely out of [members’] possession.”
",-1
"The six-page letter says:
",-1
"• In September of 2016 … the CHA and [IG] briefed the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus about suspicious activity related to their server that the [IG] identified.
",-1
"As a result, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus directed the CAO to copy the data from their server and two computers.
",-1
"• The CHA directed the IG to refer the matter to the US Capitol Police.
",-1
"The USCP initiated an investigation that continues to this day.
",-1
"• In late 2016, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus announced his intention to resign from Congress to assume a new position.
",-1
"The CAO and [sergeant-at-arms] worked with the Chairman to account for his inventory, including the one server.
",-1
"• While reviewing the inventory, the CAO discovered that the serial number of the server did not match that of the one imaged in September.
",-1
"[Investigators] also discovered that the server in question [the replacement server] was still operating under the employee’s control, contrary to the explicit instructions of the former chairman to turn over all equipment and fully cooperate with the inquiry and investigation.
",-1
"[A House source said the ""employee” was Abid Awan.]
",-1
"• The USCP interviewed relevant staff regarding the missing server.
",-1
"• On January 24, 2017, the CAO acquired the [r[replacement]erver from the control of the employees and transferred that server to the USCP.
",-1
"President Donald Trump referenced the Democratic Caucus’ missing server in a tweet.
",-1
"An IG presentation from September 2016 shows that Becerra knew of problems months before the server disappeared.
",-1
"“The Caucus Chief of Staff requested one of the shared employees to not provide IT services or access their computers,” it read.
",-1
"A House official close to the probe said the employee was Abid, who was not on Becerra or the Caucus’s payroll.
",-1
"The official said Becerra Chief of Staff Sean McCluskie apparently knew Abid was accessing Caucus servers.
",-1
"According to payroll records, Abid’s sister-in-law, Hina Alvi, was the Caucus’ systems administrator.
",-1
"The Awans’ continued physical access to Becerra’s equipment after red flags emerged enabled the server to disappear after it became evidence, House officials close to the investigation told TheDCNF.
",-1
"(RELATED: Becerra Tried To Block Awan From House Democratic Caucus Server, But Logins Continued; He Didn’t Go To Cops)
",-1
"Becerra has refused to comment, citing an ongoing criminal investigation.
",-1
"“These employees accessed user accounts and computers for offices that did not employ them, without the knowledge and permission of the impacted Member’s office,” it said, adding, “4 of the employees accessed the Democratic Caucus computers 5,735 times.” More than 100 office computers were open to access from people not on the office’s staff, it said.
",-1
"Chris Gowen — a former aide to Hillary Clinton who is now serving as Imran’s attorney — told TheDCNF, “There is no missing server and never was.”
",-1
"The memo said the CHA possesses voluminous evidence, including, “Interview notes with House Members’ Chiefs of Staff,” and “Logon activity and computer access logs.” Prosecutors have not brought charges.
",-1
"The Awans were banned from Congress’s computer network the day the letter was sent, and Kiko held a briefing to convey the message to chiefs of staff for members who employed them.
",-1
"But Democrats claim they were never told about any of the cybersecurity issues itemized in the urgent memo.
",-1
"Rep. Jackie Speier — a California Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who employed Imran and his wife, Hina Alvi — said she never heard of any missing server.
",-1
"Joaquin Castro of Texas — another Democratic intelligence committee member who employed one of the Awans — told TheDCNF that Kiko never told him of any cybersecurity issues whatsoever and that the Awan probe was instead described as a theft issue.
",-1
"Yet even the alleged theft has not resulted in criminal charges — even though the letter also says House authorities have “purchase orders and vouchers” that allegedly show procurement fraud, as well as testimony from a Democratic chief of staff to Rep. Yvette Clarke, who warned of procurement fraud.
",-1
"The FBI arrested Imran at the airport in July 2017 for alleged bank fraud that occurred six months prior, and Democrats have since claimed that the case is about nothing but bank fraud.
",-1
"Bank fraud does not explain why the Awans were kicked off the House network concurrent with the urgent memo, which did not cite bank fraud.
",-1
"Wendy Anderson, a former chief of staff to New York Rep. Yvette Clarke, told House investigators that she suspected that her predecessor, Shelley Davis, was working with Abid on a theft scheme, but Clarke refused to fire Abid until outside investigators got involved, TheDCNF reported.

"President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued presidential pardons to two Oregon cattle ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, convicted in 2012 of committing arson on federal lands near their ranch.
",-1
"The father and son's 2016 imprisonment — and the armed protest at a national wildlife refuge that followed — formed a flashpoint in the ongoing dispute between cattle ranchers and the federal government over land-use rights.
",-1
"“The Hammonds are multi-generation cattle ranchers in Oregon imprisoned in connection with a fire that leaked onto a small portion of neighboring public grazing land,” the White House said in a statement.
",-1
"“Justice is overdue for Dwight and Steven Hammond, both of whom are entirely deserving of these Grants of Executive Clemency.”
",-1
"The Hammonds asserted they were taking preventative measures to protect their property from wildfires and invasive plants; the federal government maintained they were attempting to mask illegal deer hunting, among other things.

"After a sympathetic federal judge ruled the 5-year mandatory minimum sentence unconstitutional, the father and son walked away with sentences of three months and one year respectively.
",-1
"Prosecutors appealed, and the 9th U.S.
",-1
"Circuit Court of Appeals later reversed the decision, resentencing the men to 5 years apiece (a move the White House statement called ""unjust"").
",-1
"The duo’s subsequent arrival at a California prison to complete the remainder of their sentences triggered a 300-person march and later, a protest at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.
",-1
"There, armed occupiers — including Ammon Bundy, whose father Cliven Bundy participated in a similar 2014 standoff — faced off with federal agents for 41 days in dispute of the jail time, which they saw as punishment for the Hammond family’s refusal to sell the government its land.
",-1
"“We felt we had exhausted all prudent measures,” Bundy said in a news conference at the time.
",-1
"“Do we allow this to go on, or do we make a stand?”
",-1
"The Hammonds’ attorneys had sought clemency from former President Barack Obama, The Oregonian reported.

"Today, President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Grants of Clemency (Full Pardons) for Dwight Lincoln Hammond, Jr., and his son, Steven Hammond.

"Ex-Sailor Pardoned By Trump, Sues Obama And Comey For NOT Prosecuting Hillary
",-1
"The former Navy sailor pardoned by President Donald Trump after serving a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of his submarine filed a lawsuit on Monday against Obama administration officials.
",-1
"The ex-sailor is alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law and cites Comey and Obama’s willingness to not prosecute Hillary Clinton.
",-1
"Barack Obama and former FBI director James Comey let Hillary off the hook before the election, while Kristian Saucier served hard time.
",-1
"Saucier says that that action was “unfair” and “unequal” compared to the corruption and criminal activity of Hillary Clinton.
",-1
"Saucier’s lawsuit names as defendants former President Barack Obama, former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who led the inquiry into Clinton’s email account.
",-1
"“I could have just taken the pardon by President Trump and gone on with my life,” Saucier said to Fox News, adding that he feels an obligation to get to the truth of what he sees as a double standard that let Clinton get off scot-free.
",-1
"“The U.S. Constitution clearly states that all citizens are born with inalienable rights to be free from persecution by the government,” Saucier said.
",-1
"The former Navy sailor is acting as his own attorney after the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court New York barred his lawyer, Ronald Daigle, from practicing for one year.
",-1
"The court’s move came just as Daigle was helping Saucier prepare to file the lawsuit, prompting the navy sailor to accuse New York officials of trying to hinder his court fight against Obama, Comey, and others.
",-1
"Saucier said that he realizes he had erred in taking the photos of the submarine, which he said he wanted to show only to his family so that they could see where he worked.

"French Jewish woman’s killer found unfit to stand trial in 2nd evaluation
",-1
"The suspect in the alleged murder of a Jewish physician in Paris was not responsible for his actions, a second psychiatric evaluation has determined, contradicting an earlier assessment.
",-1
"The president of the CRIF umbrella of French Jewish communities protested the court’s decision to revisit the issue of suitability to stand trial of Kobili Traore, which the court pursued on its own initiative and not at the request of his defense.
",-1
"In January, Traore was determined to be fit to stand trial.
",-1
"He was placed in a psychiatric hospital for weeks after his arrest in the April 2017 killing of Sarah Halimi despite having no history of mental illness.

"But a judge requested a second series of tests, which determined that the Malian immigrant was not able to stand trial, 20 Minutes reported Wednesday.
",-1
"A third evaluation will follow before the court finally reaches a decision.
",-1
"An aggravated element of a hate crime was added to Traore’s indictment following vocal protests by CRIF, which said that the omission of such charges may have part of a “cover up” by French authorities.
",-1
"This just continues the pattern.
",-1
"I wrote about the murder of Sarah Halimi last year.
",-1
"She died on the street outside the building where she had lived for thirty years.
",-1
"The killer had allegedly shouted, “Allahu Akbar”.

"Allahu Akbar usually means motive unknown.

",-1
"Then they were dropped.
",-1
"Now they're letting him get away with it.
",-1
"Three minutes later, a unit of the Anti-Crime Brigade (BAC) — who happened to be patrolling the area — took up position in front of Diara’s door.
",-1
"They heard Kobili Traore chanting Muslim prayers and Koranic verses.
",-1
"Unsure about the situation and the potential threats to the family, they asked for reinforcements.
",-1
"Additional policemen arrived quickly.
",-1
"However, for some unclear reason, the BAC unit still refrained from breaking in.
",-1
"In the meantime, Kobili Traore put on new clothes and climbed out of the window to reach Sarah Halimi’s apartment, which was at the same level as Diara Traore’s.
",-1
"From time to time he resumed Koranic recitation.
",-1
"Yet the police still failed to storm Sarah Halimi’s apartment and rescue her.
",-1
"Eventually, Kobili Traore is claimed to have shouted that the woman was “mad and about to commit suicide”, and threw her out of the window.
",-1
"He had time enough to climb back to Diara Traore’s apartment where he finally was arrested.
",-1

"FIVE YEARS AGO, 25-year-old radical libertarian Cody Wilson stood on a remote central Texas gun range and pulled the trigger on the world’s first fully 3-D-printed gun.
",-1
"When, to his relief, his plastic invention fired a .380-caliber bullet into a berm of dirt without jamming or exploding in his hands, he drove back to Austin and uploaded the blueprints for the pistol to his website, Defcad.com.
",-1
"Defend Yourself: A Com...
",-1
"In the days after that first test-firing, his gun was downloaded more than 100,000 times.

"Wilson made the decision to go all in on the project, dropping out of law school at the University of Texas, as if to confirm his belief that technology supersedes law.
",-1
"The law caught up.
",-1
"He took Defcad.com offline, but his lawyer warned him that he still potentially faced millions of dollars in fines and years in prison simply for having made the file available to overseas downloaders for a few days.
",-1
"…
",-1
"Two months ago, the Department of Justice quietly offered Wilson a settlement to end a lawsuit he and a group of co-plaintiffs have pursued since 2015 against the United States government.
",-1
"Wilson and his team of lawyers focused their legal argument on a free speech claim: They pointed out that by forbidding Wilson from posting his 3-D-printable data, the State Department was not only violating his right to bear arms but his right to freely share information.
",-1
"By blurring the line between a gun and a digital file, Wilson had also successfully blurred the lines between the Second Amendment and the First.

",-1
"The Department of Justice’s surprising settlement, confirmed in court documents earlier this month, essentially surrenders to that argument.
",-1
"It promises to change the export control rules surrounding any firearm below .50 caliber—with a few exceptions like fully automatic weapons and rare gun designs that use caseless ammunition—and move their regulation to the Commerce Department, which won’t try to police technical data about the guns posted on the public internet.

"In the meantime, it gives Wilson a unique license to publish data about those weapons anywhere he chooses.

"DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment
",-1
"The Trump DOJ settled with Wilson, finally acknowledging that his 3D print gun files are protected as free speech under the First Amendment.
",-1
"I first reported that 3-D guns were for real back in July of 2012, when an internet gunsmith by the name of ""Have Blue"" produced an AR style pistol that fired both .22 and .223 caliber bullets.
",-1
"Later, Cody Wilson, 25, a law student at the University of Texas and founder of the non-profit group Defense Distributed, had produced a 3-D printed handgun made entirely of ABS plastic with only a metal firing pin.
",-1
"In 2013, Wilson had the information on how to build the gun removed from public access at the request of the United States Department of Defense Trade Controls.
",-1
"According to Wilson, they seized control of the information.

"So, what did he do?

"The Second Amendment Foundation has issued the following press release:
",-1
"BELLEVUE, WA – The Department of Justice and Second Amendment Foundation have reached a settlement in SAF’s lawsuit on behalf of Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed over free speech issues related to 3-D files and other information that may be used to manufacture lawful firearms.
",-1
"Under terms of the settlement, the government has agreed to waive its prior restraint against the plaintiffs, allowing them to freely publish the 3-D files and other information at issue.
",-1
"The government has also agreed to pay a significant portion of the plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees, and to return $10,000 in State Department registration dues paid by Defense Distributed as a result of the prior restraint.
",-1
"Significantly, the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber – including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms – are not inherently military.
",-1
"“For years, anti-gunners have contended that modern semi-automatic sport-utility rifles are so-called ‘weapons of war,’ and with this settlement, the government has acknowledged they are nothing of the sort.
",-1
"“Under this settlement,” he continued, “the government will draft and pursue regulatory amendments that eliminate ITAR control over the technical information at the center of this case.
",-1
"They will transfer export jurisdiction to the Commerce Department, which does not impose prior restraint on public speech.
",-1
"That will allow Defense Distributed and SAF to publish information about 3-D technology.” The Second Amendment Foundation (www.saf.org) is the nation’s oldest and largest tax-exempt education, research, publishing and legal action group focusing on the Constitutional right and heritage to privately own and possess firearms.
",-1
"Founded in 1974, The Foundation has grown to more than 600,000 members and supporters and conducts many programs designed to better inform the public about the consequences of gun control.
",-1
"What does all this mean?
",-1
"Because now, anyone with access to the internet and a 3D printer can print their very own gun that is unregistered.
",-1
"That's right, and it's perfectly legal to do so.
",-1
"And we aren't just talking a rigid looking one-shot handgun.
",-1
"We're talking ARs, 1911s and a host of other guns.
",-1
"This actually may end up undermining the gun manufacturing industry in the future, as people will be able to build their own guns at home in a similar manner to how the internet has had a dramatic effect on the retail brick and mortar stores.
",-1
"I don't know that I would go quite that far, after all, the settlement does state that ""the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber – including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms – are not inherently military.""
",-1
"Therefore, the government still believes it has a right to regulate certain arms, which it does not have authority to do.

"""This doesn’t put the rifle in everyone’s hand, but it does that in essence"" he added.

"In his remarks to members of Congress Tuesday that were televised by the media, President Trump went on to admit that he realized he needed to clarify his statements in Helsinki.
",-1
"The president said: “It should have been obvious – I thought it would be obvious – but I would like to clarify, just in case it wasn’t.
",-1
"In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word ‘would’ instead of “wouldn’t.” The sentence should have been: I don’t see any reason why I wouldn’t – or why it wouldn’t be Russia.

"For him, this was a big correction (and as I noted the day before, it was an absolutely necessary one).
",-1
"President Trump said: “President Obama, along with (then-CIA Director John) Brennan and (then Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper and the whole group that you see on television now – probably getting paid a lot of money by your networks – they knew about Russia’s attempt to interfere in the election in September, and they totally buried it.

"There are two key facts in this statement.
",-1
"It was their duty in 2016 – not candidate Trump’s.
",-1
"Second, the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being.
",-1
"Also, President Trump’s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy.
",-1
"Furthermore, President Trump’s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin.
",-1
"President Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York.
",-1
"More than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons.

"Nothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime.
",-1
"We are in the early stages of a cultural civil war in which the left sees itself losing.

"With President Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, it was clear that anyone Trump nominated was going to be attacked.
",-1
"In fact, the demonstrators protesting the nomination had signs for all four of the finalists and were instantly ready to oppose the president regardless of his choice.
",-1
"Whatever the Russians did, they did while Brennan was director of the CIA, Clapper was director of national intelligence, and James Comey was head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
",-1
"Just keep that in mind the next time you see one of them on TV.

"And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
",-1
"And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?

",-1
"The most downloads came from Spain, followed by the U.S., Brazil and Germany.
",-1
"Within days of the gun file being uploaded, the Obama State Department served Wilson with a letter threatening criminal prosecution for violating federal export controls.
",-1
"Wilson immediately complied with the order, but there was no way to stop further downloading.
",-1
"Within a week of the initial uploading, the file could be downloaded on the Internet from over 4,000 different computers around the world.
",-1
"In 2015, the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) and DD sued the State Department, arguing that ""sharing instructions on how to make guns with 3D printers counts as constitutionally protected speech.

"This is an important victory for First Amendment rights.""
",-1
"The Justice Department’s recent settlement with Wilson is very favorable to him, allowing Wilson to provide the printing instructions “for public release (meaning unlimited distribution) in any form.” The government also compensated $40,000 of Wilson’s legal costs.

"How the government will stop people from obtaining these printers isn’t exactly obvious.
",-1
"Proposals to require background checks, mandatory serial numbers and even a registration process for printers are easily defeated.

"Even if printers are registered with the government, what is going to stop gangs from stealing them?

"Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”
",-1
"Well, it’s been quite a couple of news weeks for the Catholic Church, hey?
",-1
"McCarrick, Pineda/Maradiaga, Fr.
",-1
"The anger of the laity over the McCarrick situation is boiling over into the Twitter feed of the people we still call “the good bishops”.
",-1
"It’s clear that even the “good bishops” have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out of their own churches by furious mobs.
",-1
"We are seeing the final slide, the expected and inevitable result of the last 100 years.
",-1
"The McCarrick news – and all the stuff swirling around it like the latest about Bishop Pineda and his connection to Pope Francis through Cardinal Maradiaga – has not come in contrast to this but as an intrinsic part of it.
",-1
"Rod Dreher[1] is doing excellent work compiling testimony from priests and others saying out loud at last what many of us had known for many years about McCarrick and his gang.
",-1
"It has shown the world what Traditionalists have known, that it is emphatically NOT the result of one “bad apple” or even only a “few” as the hapless “conservative” Bishop Tobin tried to claim on Twitter.
",-1
"This is the result of a mass-collusion.
",-1
"As our friend Steve Skojec put it the other day, “We’ve got to stop pretending it’s just the progressive element in the Church.
",-1
"The ‘conservatives’ are complicit, too.” In short, as it was during his days of glory, globe trotting on the dime of the State Department, hosting presidents for dinner and inviting John Paul II and Mother Theresa to tea, so it is now: McCarrick is the face of the New Paradigm.
",-1
"Whether he now has to go live in obscurity in some beach house in the Caymans, it will remain true: McCarrick is the “New Church.”
",-1
"In briefest and simplest possible terms, immoral or even illegal sexual activity is preferred because it leaves a man open to blackmail, to control through fear of exposure[2].
",-1
"When that blackmailing culture becomes ascendant, it will always reject the morally upright as too dangerous, too difficult to control.
",-1
"This is why faithful seminarians are rejected and why faithful priests are harassed.
",-1
"As Dreher reported,
",-1
"Gay seminarians who intend to be celibate, Sipe said, face tremendous pressure to have sex.
",-1
"If they slip up even once, their failure will be noted, and shared… And they will be made to understand that their lapse is remembered.
",-1
"Later, as a priest, predators within the priesthood have that knowledge to hold over the heads of other gay priests, to keep them silent if they ever have the desire to blow whistles.
",-1
"When I was covering the scandal in the early 2000s, I spoke to several, unconnected heterosexual men — priests, former priests, seminarians — who said that gay seminary rectors or diocesan officials encouraged them to take female sexual partners, so that they too would be complicit in sexual secret-keeping, and therefore no longer [be] a potential danger.
",-1
"Nothing in a system like that is a greater threat to the corrupt than men who are not corrupt.
",-1
"For many priests, one might say all good priests, this is not a sustainable situation, to say the least.
",-1
"I’ve had quite a few conversations with priests who are now asking how to deal with it.
",-1
"How are they to continue to offer the sacraments in this situation?
",-1
"Where are they to live?
",-1
"How are they to maintain themselves?
",-1
"As men known to be incorruptible themselves, there is a big target painted on their backs.
",-1
"In short, not only can a bad bishop harry a man out of his ministry, he has complete control over the priest’s material life.
",-1
"The bishop can, with the flick of a pen or a single phone call, render a priest homeless, penniless and jobless.
",-1
"And these, remember, are men, often well on in years, whose only education and employment training has likely been academic degrees in philosophy and theology, and whose only professional contacts are ecclesiastical.
",-1
"Moreover, because of the globalisation of the bishop-network, a man blackballed for his authentic Catholicity will be a pariah in every diocese in the world.
",-1
"And with the advent of Bergoglio in Rome, there are no more havens; as many of the former Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate have learned, the blackballing has gone global with this pontificate.
",-1
"He will remain a pariah even among the so-called “good” bishops who live in terror of the immense power of the cabal… (see above re: McCarrick & President Bush/John Paul II.)
",-1
"I have been hearing from priests who are saying in effect, “We’re trapped in this situation and forced to remain silent because if we don’t we’ll not only be unable to function as priests, but we’ll be homeless and penniless.
",-1
"Many priests are getting older – many of them with health issues – and a man who has already given 20 or 30 years of his life to the Church is faced with a practical impossibility if he finds himself blacklisted.
",-1
"Of course there are some who don’t fit this mould; there are a lot of second careers in the priesthood and plenty of people go into seminary after some years in the normal workforce and can go back to it at need.
",-1
"Some of the men now coming forward with complaints against McCarrick, who left the priesthood over their experiences, have gone on to have normal, healthy working lives.
",-1
"But I think honestly most priests are in this corner and they know it and so do their bishops.
",-1
"I think a young man goes forward in great faith, spends ten to fifteen years studying philosophy and theology - fields that have almost no application in the workforce outside academia or the Church - with the honest, and frankly fair, expectation of a lifetime of employment and a safety net at the end.
",-1
"As one of them said to me, “The old arrangement was, ‘Remain faithful, do the work, and we will look after you.
",-1
"So what do we do?
",-1
"The Old Paradigm is destroyed and going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else.
",-1
"As we saw in Ireland this week, the Purge has started.
",-1
"It’s not enough to simply demand that a priest continue in his ministry no matter what.
",-1
"We need to start working together with faithful priests – while there still are some – to help them create practical material alternatives.
",-1
"If we who still love the Church want priests to be faithful, and even to start denouncing the evil and corruption they see, we are going to have to help them create a modicum of independence and security in which to do it.
",-1
"The other day the American conservative writer, John Zmirak, wrote a sound suggestion on Twitter that I think it’s time we all started taking seriously.
",-1
"In response to the continued outrages of both “good” and bad bishops, Zmirak suggested establishing “an escrow fund in each scandal-plagued diocese, where laymen [can] deposit the funds they would have donated to [the] local church, until [a] new bishop [is] appointed.”
",-1
"I responded: “And the money could be used to purchase properties to house faithful priests punished by their bishops for refusing the New Paradigm.
",-1
"We could even perhaps buy a few convents so contemplative nuns could continue to pray in peace, without harassment from the evil men in Rome.”
",-1
"I am hearing lately from laymen who are starting to talk about setting up financial structures to ensure that the authentic Catholic life can be maintained through what is obviously soon to be a general collapse of the institution.
",-1
"This would mean independent non-profit foundations that could build or buy church buildings, convents and even schools and provide salaries for priests and other staff.
",-1
"I started thinking about this recently when I received a note from a reader with a link to an online petition from Germany, addressed to the German bishops [!!!]
",-1
"I responded that this was going about things the wrong way.
",-1
"Catholics are going to have to get their heads out of the mindset that they are helpless petitioners, “begging” the hierarchy to maintain the Faith.
",-1
"First of all, it only gives them a frisson of pleasure to see us groveling and begging for mercy.
",-1
"Let’s not give them that, OK?
",-1
"There’s already enough “frissons of pleasure” in their lives.
",-1
"Second, it’s simply not going to work.
",-1
"They’ve become so by making themselves the enemies of Christ and His Holy Church.
",-1
"They know it and it’s time we stopped imagining otherwise.
",-1
"The other suggestion I have is for young men interested in the priesthood to fortify themselves not only spiritually but in the material sphere.
",-1
"There’s one big vulnerability we can guard against pretty easily.
",-1
"No one should be facing penury and permanent unemployment because he’s a faithful Catholic.
",-1
"We should never be letting any young man go into any diocesan seminary without being a property owner.
",-1
"He should own a house or stand to inherit one.
",-1
"Families have to come to see this as a duty to the child and to the Church.
",-1
"And more than that, the potential priest needs to have job skills that have nothing to do with the priesthood.
",-1
"Among the working classes there is a bias against intellectual work.
",-1
"But most working class people have a pretty sensible attitude towards ambitions in academia: get something under your belt you can fall back on.
",-1
"How many philosophy PhDs can build himself a bookshelf?
",-1
"Change the oil in a car?
",-1
"Rewire a house?
",-1
"The standard cliché of young people with useless academic degrees working at Starbucks has become so common it’s not even worth memeing anymore.
",-1
"How many young men do we foresee being forced out of seminary for having the wrong “sexual orientation”?
",-1
"Every one of those guys needs to be able to snap his fingers in the face of the rector and walk straight into a decent job, based not on any recommendation from a corrupt bishop, but on his solid skills.
",-1
"Among the white collar classes there is a bias against blue collar work, but the trades are crying out for skilled men and a trade school diploma in fixing tractors is a lot cheaper and a lot faster to get than a university degree.
",-1
"That’s an economic asset that we can’t afford to turn up our well-educated noses at.

"It reminds me of a discussion I had some years ago with the prior of a Benedictine monastery that is attracting a lot of young vocations.
",-1
"One kid wanted to join and told me they had recommended he go to some college or other to study philosophy first.
",-1
"This college, apparently, waives much of the tuition and gives work studies to people going for the priesthood and religious life so they can avoid the student loan trap.
",-1
"This is fine, good idea.
",-1
"But I asked him what he knew how to do.
",-1
"“Can you fix a bathroom pipe?
",-1
"Do you know anything about what to feed a sheep or how to care for a cow?
",-1
"Can you drive a tractor?” This nice kid, who certainly does have a vocation, could read books and look things up on the internet and write a pretty mean paper on Thomas Aquinas, but not a lot else.
",-1
"There is going to have to be a shift in attitude in our remaining faithful institutions.
",-1
"Does a monastery really need all of its members to have PhDs in philosophy and theology?
",-1
"Wouldn’t it also be useful to have an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a cook, someone who knows how to fix a car or a tractor?
",-1
"Or for that matter, a certified accountant or an investment banker?
",-1
"If you insist on having people with degrees, maybe a degree in agriculture would be a good fit for a big monastic foundation with a lot of land like, say, Clear Creek or that new Carmelite place in Nebraska.
",-1
"I think this is the time we are going to have to start overcoming our class snobbery.
",-1
"Young men with ambitions for the priesthood are going to have to tuck away employability and an independent financial foundation, in the same way people used to tuck money away against a rainy day.
",-1
"Simply put, they’ve got to stop being materially dependent on the hierarchy.
",-1
"This vulnerability is a gun to their heads in this time.
",-1
"The next kid who says anything to me about wanting to enter the diocesan priesthood, I’m going to ask, “How sound is your investment portfolio?” The next candidate for religious life, I’ll ask, “Great!
",-1
"What’s your trade?
",-1
"What do you have to fall back on?”
",-1
"I’m given to understand that some houses of the Congregation of the Oratory ask candidates to come with an independent income, which, given what we’re seeing elsewhere doesn’t sound like a bad idea.
",-1
"Perhaps Catholic financial advisors could be encouraged to set up a programme to teach young men how to create a sound financial footing with investments.
",-1
"Meanwhile, we must refocus our energy on the Faith itself, instead of the physical and even canonical structures that house it.
",-1
"That monastery in Germany is lost.
",-1
"Those bishops want the property and they’ll get it.
",-1
"What the group of laymen should be doing, instead of petitioning that it be saved, is finding a place where the nuns can live their charism of religious life without episcopal harassment.
",-1
"Bishops won’t protect and support good priests?
",-1
"The Vatican wants to force all religious congregations into the pants-wearing, Marxist anti-nun, LCWR pattern?
",-1
"We’re not helpless.
",-1
"We start buying convent buildings and start a fund to support the nun-refugees.
",-1
"Our goal must be preserving the precious treasure, the Deposit of the Faith, the sacramental life, the great charisms and artifacts of the religious life.
",-1
"I am reminded of what the curators of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg did in the face of the advancing German army.
",-1
"They took down, packed up and hid the art treasures, some of the greatest in the world.
",-1
"Over a million precious works of art were sent on trains to be hidden in the Urals.
",-1
"Two trains got away to safety, but one was still there when the Germans surrounded the city and began the siege.
",-1
"The museum’s website tells us:
",-1
"“Despite starvation and severely cold temperatures, the Museum continued its preservational functions.
",-1
"With only a skeleton staff left behind, it was difficult to protect the vast buildings and their sumptuous interiors against snow, wind and rain.
",-1
"Equipped with first-aid kits, wearing helmets and gloves, the Museum air wardens cleared away heaps of broken bricks and the remains of charred flooring after each bomb hit the building; they helped dig out the living and the dead and bandage the wounded after raids in the surrounding area.
",-1
"Twelve air-raid shelters were fitted out in the basements of the Museum complex and until the first evacuations were made in March 1942 there were 12,000 people housed there permanently, among them the Museum Director, celebrated Academician Iosif Orbeli.” “Hermitage staff both in Sverdlovsk and in Leningrad acted as museum attendants, continuing their scholarly activity and lecturing in hospitals, holding conferences, writing scholarly articles.
",-1
"No items were lost during the evacuation.”
",-1
"To keep up everyone’s morale, the museum staff, while bombs were falling and they and their patrons were equally starving, continued to give tours and lectures, describing perfectly the artworks that had been removed.
",-1
"They understood the value of what they had, and did everything within their power to preserve and protect it.
",-1
"Does this all sound a bit, well, schismatic?
",-1
"Not necessarily.
",-1
"But we’d be fools to wait for them.
",-1
"Whatever you might think of Archbishop Lefebvre’s solution over the last few decades, it certainly seems inarguable that the “state of emergency” for which he was preparing has come at last.
",-1
"And in a state of emergency, certain norms are naturally suspended.
",-1
"The simple fact is that soon there are going to be “vagus” priests who have been thrown out of their ministry for maintaining the Faith.
",-1
"There are going to be nuns and monks without homes, as in the England of Henry VIII.
",-1
"I think it’s only reasonable that those who also want to maintain the Faith should reach out to them and offer what shelter we can.
",-1
"What we have seen this week is making it clear that we can simply no longer sit back and “beg” bishops to maintain and defend the Faith.
",-1
"It’s not enough now to go into seminary or a monastery with glowing eyes and a firm faith.
",-1
"Sentiment isn’t going to be much comfort when the young man is no longer so very young and finds himself standing on the street outside the chancery with no skills, no money, no job, (no health insurance) and no prospects.
",-1
"Let’s stop lamenting and start doing practical things about it.

"[1] Dreher and others are asking some very important questions now about the activities of the men McCarrick is known to have mentored, one of whom is currently making interesting headlines as Pope Francis’ Cardinal Prefect of the new Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life, and as the primary organiser of the upcoming World Meeting of Families in his native Dublin.
",-1
"It should probably be noted that up to the time he left over a “difference of opinion” with the group’s leadership, Cardinal Kevin Farrell as also deeply involved in the Legionaries of Christ.
",-1
"He joined in 1966, was ordained in ’78, and was quickly appointed to a high-ranking position as general director with responsibility for seminaries and schools of the Legionaries of Christ in Italy, Spain and Ireland until 1983.
",-1
"This period was at the peak of the power of the grotesquely corrupt Fr.
",-1
"Maciel, for whom it has been shown ALL the Legion’s leadership was covering.
",-1
"The Farrell family’s involvement in the Legion continues with his brother, Bishop Brian Farrell, who ordained 20 new priests to the questionable-but-officially-reformed community in 2015.
",-1
"A recent post to the official Regnum Christi website shows that Cardinal Kevin is still close enough to the Legion-related “lay” organisation to hire dicastery staff from their ranks.
",-1
"After he left the Legion, Kevin Farrell joined the diocesan clergy in Washington DC and became a protégé of the archbishop, Cardinal Wuerl.
",-1
"So close is he to McCarrick that Farrell’s coat of arms, as Elizabeth Yore reported in these pages, is not much more than a tribute to his belatedly-disgraced mentor.
",-1
"So, someone in a journalistic capacity might want to be asking a few questions about these things too.

"Not that he said things the way he should have.
",-1
"President Trump really did mess up with that press conference but I don’t quite know what people want.

"So let me just make two points.
",-1
"Number one is, if you look at President Obama versus President Trump, there’s no question that President Obama was more cooperative with and collaborative with Russia and the Russian agenda than President Trump.
",-1
"President Trump has bombed the Assad forces in Syria, a client state of Putin, something that Obama refused to do because he didn’t want to provoke Putin.
",-1
"Trump undid the Iran deal, which Russia favored, while Obama worked with Russia in order to do the Iran deal.

",-1
"The other issue that I want to make is that, you know, again, this idea that somehow that you are endorsing the repression of other countries’ leaders if you meet with them—it is true that Trump has never criticized Putin, although he has taken all the steps I just outlined against Putin.
",-1
"It is true President Trump likes fascist and authoritarian leaders, and that is a problem, but it’s not like Putin is the only leader that he doesn’t criticize.

"Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran
",-1
"On August 5, 1964, the New York Times reported, “President Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and ‘certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam’ after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.” Additional outlets, such as the Washington Post, echoed this claim.
",-1
"But it wasn’t true.
",-1
"In fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam — leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese, fomenting the largest anti-war movement in American history, and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world.
",-1
"In 2010, more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released, proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House.
",-1
"But while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn’t be disputed.
",-1
"Tom Wells, author of the exhaustive exposé “The War Within: America’s Battle Over Vietnam,” explained the media egregiously erred in “almost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information” and “reluctance to question official pronouncements on ‘national security issues.’”
",-1
"If due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it’s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did.
",-1
"Sadly, the United States has a tendency to repeat the same mistakes over and over again.
",-1
"And now, a US Army Colonel is predicting that another Gulf of Tonkin incident could bring us into war with Iran.
",-1
"The rhetoric is becoming so strong, that Trump himself — without provocation — began tweeting threats to the sovereign nation.
",-1
"On Tuesday, Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Colonel Douglas Macgregor addressed the growing prospect of US war with Iran and warned that a new “Gulf of Tonkin incident” could be used to drag us into it.
",-1
"“Let’s hope that he understands exactly what’s going on.”
",-1
"Pointing out Trump’s recent attempts at diplomacy with North Korea and Russia, Col. Macgregor weighed in, noting that he thinks Trump will attempt to avoid war with Iran.
",-1
"However, he noted that a false flag could be used to drag us into it.
",-1
"“I think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident,” Col. Macgregor said.
",-1
"“Many of your viewers may not remember that it never happened and we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf.
",-1
"We should watch for that, and this is an example of President Trump’s comments on fake news, he should not be sabotage by fake news.”
",-1
"Carlson then pointed out how the Trump admin has reacted to fake news by attacking Syria—twice.
",-1
"For those who may be unaware, the plan to overthrow Iran has long been in the works.
",-1
"In fact, in April 2012, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained (Mojahedin-e Khalq) MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009.
",-1
"Coincidentally, MEK was classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and its allies—during this training period—until they suddenly removed them from the list in 2012.
",-1
"To those paying attention over the years, Trump’s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report.

"The case involves Cody Wilson, founder of Defense Distributed, who sued the government in 2015 after the State Department under the Obama administration made him take down do-it-yourself gunmaking blueprints he had posted online, saying they violated export regulations governing military hardware and technology.
",-1
"But he lost at every stage of litigation, including a refusal by the Supreme Court to review a decision that the code could not be published during the course of the lawsuit.
",-1
"In addition to signing off on the public release of the 3-D printing tutorials, the State Department also agreed to pay nearly $40,000 of Mr. Wilson’s legal fees.

"The first order of business is to scuttle the upcoming October Synod on Young People, the Faith, and Vocational Discernment.
",-1
"This Synod is designed to exploit the youth, like they’ve been doing for the last 60 years.

",-1
"We are no longer Shocked, just fed up.
",-1
"Let’s start with the Cardinal who will lead the upcoming Synod, none other than Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Prefect of the Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life.
",-1
"Undoubtedly, Farrell as the head of this Synod chose his dear friend gay friendly, Fr.
",-1
"James Martin, S.J.

"to keynote the Synod.
",-1
"exposes his obvious underlying homosexual agenda and aura of the upcoming Synod:
",-1
"“A welcome and much-needed book that will help bishops, priests, pastoral associates, and all church leaders more compassionately minister to the LGBT community.
",-1
"It will also help LGBT Catholics feel more at home in what is, after all, their church.”
",-1
"What merciful praise for Martin’s book, Cardinal Farrell!
",-1
"Contrary to the theme of mercy and compassion to LGBTs, it appears that your mentor, McCarrick set out to groom and grow an LGBT community.
",-1
"Clearly, you and Fr.
",-1
"Martin have much in common since you both claimed you were “shocked” by the McCarrick allegations.
",-1
"Explain to Catholics why would you headline a homosexual affirming speaker at a Synod for youth and seminarians?
",-1
"In case you haven’t been reading the McCarrick headlines or noticing the plunging mass attendance and collections, Catholics don’t trust their boys around priests and are furious that their seminarians are subjected to unrelenting homosexual sexual harassment.
",-1
"McCarrick is the last straw.
",-1
"The October Synod is yet another example of Church leaders exploiting Catholic youth for their own personal power agenda and selfish motives.

"Dare, if you will, to read the thrill, the excitement and anticipated results of the Synod in the radical New Ways Gay Catholic Ministry article, entitled, Youth Synod Document shows Vatican evolution on LGBT Topics.

"The article highlights the New Ways excitement over the shift in the Vatican approach to the LGBT issues at the Synod:
",-1
"“Another significant development is the acknowledgement that LGBT people have a desire to be part of the church.
",-1
"In one section, the document states: “some LGBT youth … wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care from the Church.” “This acknowledgement is a welcome change from the hierarchy’s traditional rhetoric that suggests LGBT people are opposed to religion.
",-1
"As New Ways Ministry knows from over 40 years of pastoral work with the LGBT community, LGBT Catholics have a deep spirituality, often forged by remarkable journeys overcoming rejection, alienation, and marginalization.
",-1
"LGBT Catholics have stayed a part of the church, despite statements and actions which have offended and hurt them.”
",-1
"The New Ways article highlights the efforts of Cardinal Kevin Farrell and his Vatican cronies to promote the LGBT agenda for the upcoming Synod:
",-1
"“A third development is that the document shows that Vatican officials paid attention to concerns about LGBT issues which were raised by youth at a pre-synod meeting in Rome during March of this year, and also from youth around the world who made their views known to the Vatican online.”
",-1
"Lest there be any doubt about the secret agenda and outcome of this Synod, Cardinal Baldisseri raises the exclusion rainbow flag.
",-1
"Baldisseri notes that the upcoming Synod is to “make the entire Church aware of its important mission to accompany every young person, none excluded.”
",-1
"This papacy is awash in the prissy, pop psycho speak, jargon of accompaniment, listening, and dialogue dazzling the media with empty tropes and luring the uncatechized into its globalist mantra of one world new age religion.

"Welcome to the dumbing down of the Catholic Faith by the St. Gallen Mafia and their don, Jorge Bergoglio.

"Later, a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was appointed to carry out the investigation.
",-1
"Trump’s lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Jay A. Sekulow, said in a telephone interview that the president was not ordering the inquiry closed but simply expressing his opinion via the social media platform.

"“It’s not a call to action,” Mr. Giuliani said, adding that it was a sentiment that Mr. Trump and his lawyers have expressed publicly before.

"“He doesn’t feel that he has to intervene in the process, nor is he intervening,” said Sekulow.

"Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat of Vermont, suggested on Twitter that the president’s directive to Sessions in these recent Tweets was, in fact, obstruction.
",-1
"When I was a prosecutor, obstruction of justice was often hard to prove, requiring difficult-to-obtain evidence that the individual’s actions were truly intended to interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation.
",-1
"Oh how times have changed.

"The ongoing battle against the Trump presidency and the debate over what constitutes opinion vs. “obstruction of justice” doesn’t appear to have an end date in sight.

"“The President of the United States just called on his Attorney General to put an end to an investigation in which the President, his family and campaign may be implicated,” Schiff tweeted.
",-1
"“This is an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight.
",-1
"America must never accept it.”
",-1
"Although the White House has said that Trump’s tweets are official presidential statements, his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, responded to the latest one as he has before, by brushing off suggestions that Trump’s tweets could be used as evidence of obstruction.
",-1
"“The president was expressing his opinion on his favored medium for asserting his First Amendment right of free speech,” Giuliani said in an interview.
",-1
"“He said ‘should,’ not ‘must,’ and no presidential order was issued or will be.”
",-1
"He said he spoke with Trump to make sure that the president wasn’t actually issuing an order.
",-1
"“I talked to him about it to make sure he was on the same page as we are,” Giuliani said, and the president indicated he was not ordering Sessions to act.
",-1
"On Sunday, Giuliani told CBS’ “Face the Nation”: “Obstruction by tweet is not something I think works real well.
",-1
"Generally obstruction is secret, it’s clandestine, it’s corrupt.”
",-1
"For months, Trump’s lawyers also have argued that it’s impossible for the president to obstruct justice because his constitutional authority extends over the Justice Department.
",-1
"That power allows him to direct officials where to focus their resources or to fire them when he chooses, as Trump did when removing James B. Comey as FBI director last year.
",-1
"That firing, however, led to Mueller’s appointment as special counsel.
",-1
"He announced the decision after controversy over his own undisclosed contacts, both during the campaign and the post-election transition, with the Russian ambassador at the time, Sergey Kislyak.
",-1
"Two months ago, Trump tweeted that he should have chosen a different person as attorney general who wouldn’t have needed to recuse himself.
",-1
"“I wish I did!” he wrote.
",-1
"In his tweets, Trump also quoted criticism of the investigation from Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor who frequently defends Trump on television.
",-1
"In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Dershowitz said he does not believe Sessions has the authority to end the probe.
",-1
"“You can’t be both recused and making decisions about the investigation,” he said.
",-1
"But Dershowitz also cast doubt on whether Trump’s tweets can be seen as an act of obstruction.
",-1
"“You cannot obstruct justice by openly exercising your First Amendment rights and openly criticizing a prosecution, whether you’re right or wrong,” he said.
",-1
"“Obstruction of justice is generally committed behind the scenes, so I think both sides are a little overwrought here.”
",-1
"Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor, agreed that Sessions cannot stop the Russia investigation given that he recused himself.
",-1
"If Trump wanted to use his power to end the probe, he would have to give the order to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general supervising the Mueller team’s work, and fire Rosenstein if he does not comply, according to Vladeck.
",-1
"Trump could also try to replace Sessions as attorney general with someone who does not have a conflict of interest from the campaign, allowing that person to relieve Rosenstein of the responsibility to oversee Mueller, Vladeck said.

"The outcome of these two incidents was the passage by Congress of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted then-President Lyndon B.

"When Cain took it upon himself to inflict death on his brother Abel “in the field,” he soon learned that God furthermore reserved the exercise of this right to himself alone.
",-1
"Cain is told, “What hast thou done?
",-1
"The Fifth Commandment later delivered to Moses, “Thou shalt not kill,” therefore dates from adamic times, when it operated as God’s exclusive prerogative, allowing no exceptions.
",-1
"Only after the Flood, when Noah and his sons set about repopulating the earth, did God delegate to human society His exclusive authority to impose the death penalty for just cause.
",-1
"He told Noah, “For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man.
",-1
"19:21).
",-1
"The supreme penalty was imposed not only for murder, but for many other serious offenses: for adultery, rape, sodomy, kidnapping, for striking or cursing parents, for sacrificing a child to Moloch.
",-1
"24:16).
",-1
"Death was also decreed for refusing to accept the decision of the priests in a legal case, and an incorrigible son could be put to death on the testimony of his parents before the proper court.
",-1
"A priest’s daughter convicted of fornication was burned to death (Lev.
",-1
"21:9), but usually the sentence was carried out by stoning, in which the whole community took part as evidence that no private parties were authorized to execute a criminal, but only society as a whole, after due judgment.
",-1
"Everyone was furthermore responsible for the atonement due to God for a crime whose evil consequences would otherwise have affected them all: “The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people; that thou mayest take away the evil out of the midst of thee” (Deut.
",-1
"17:7).
",-1
"The Law read, “Defile not the land of your habitation which is stained with the blood of the innocent: neither can it otherwise be expiated, but by his blood that hath shed the blood of another” (Num.
",-1
"35:33).
",-1
"In order to emphasize the fact that it is God, and not man, who is always the principal party to be avenged, provision was made for a heifer to be killed as propitiation in the case of an unsolved murder whose perpetrator could not be found (Deut.
",-1
"20:1-9).
",-1
"After all, it is not the injury to relatives or any other human consideration that makes homicide the serious sin that it is, but as God Himself pointed out to Noah, it is the fact that “man was made to the image of God” that makes an assault on him tantamount to an assault on God.
",-1
"It is therefore to God, and not to His creatures that reparation is primarily due.
",-1
"This point was brought out by Pope Pius XII in an address to Italian Catholic jurists on May 12, 1954, when he said:
",-1
"A penalty is the reaction required by law and justice in response to a fault: penalty and fault are action and reaction.
",-1
"Order violated by a culpable act demands the reintegration and re-establishment of the disturbed equilibrium .
",-1
"A word must be said on the full meaning of penalty.
",-1
"Most of the modern theories of penal law explain penalty and justify it in the final analysis as a means of protection, that is, defense of the community against criminal undertakings, and at the same time an attempt to bring the offender to observance of the law.
",-1
"In those theories, the penalty can include sanctions such as the diminution of some goods guaranteed by law, so as to teach the guilty to live honestly, but those theories fail to consider the expiation of the crime committed, which penalizes the violation of the law as the prime function of penalty .
",-1
"In the metaphysical order, penalty is a consequence of dependence on the supreme will, dependence which exists in the deepest recesses of created being.
",-1
"If it is ever necessary to hold back the revolt of the free being and re-establish the violated law, it is when that is required by the supreme Judge and supreme Justice.
",-1
"Today the death penalty is imposed ever more rarely, even in cases of proven premeditated murder.
",-1
"John Paul II, stopping just short of declaring it wrong in principle, has declared that it should be imposed very seldom, if ever.
",-1
"But doesn’t admitting the penalty in principle demand that it be put into practice?
",-1
"If they are aware that the Church has upheld from Apostolic times the right to use force in self-defense, to kill in a just war and to inflict the death penalty on those duly judged guilty of serious crime, they now apparently subscribe to the notion propagated by Dei Verbum at the Second Vatican Council that the unchanging Catholic “tradition which comes from the Apostles” actually “develops in the Church” and keeps pace with changing times (II,8).
",-1
"The idea that man is by nature good and perfectible is allowed to override all documented evidence that hardened criminals are in fact almost impossible to rehabilitate and that those handed life sentences rarely repent of their wrongdoing.
",-1
"According to one widely held opinion, the death penalty has proved to be no effective deterrent to crime in any case, and should be discarded as impractical.
",-1
"What proof of this can possibly be offered?
",-1
"How can we know?
",-1
"Deterrence from evil is not the primary purpose of meting out punishment in any case, yet Scripture attests to deterrence as an important side effect of any penalty.
",-1
"To a man proven to have given false witness against another, Deuteronomy laid down, “They shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother.
",-1
"that others hearing may fear and may not dare to do such things.
",-1
"19:19-21).
",-1
"8:11).
",-1
"The death penalty is based on the common teachings of theologians, but is not itself a declared dogma.
",-1
"Those who argue for its abolition do not necessarily put society in danger considering possibilities of penal systems.
",-1
"I do not believe the death penalty is necessary in 90 percent of the cases where it is applied.
",-1
"Thus to call for a moratorium .
",-1
"is not unjust or incorrect.
",-1
"That the death penalty can become an instrument of revenge, and that unjust sentences are sometimes handed down can be dismissed as irrelevant to the argument.
",-1
"Considering the physical safety of society as the only real reason for executing a criminal, he feels the death penalty can now be safely discarded, allegedly on the grounds that we now have at our disposal many better ways of protecting people from him.
",-1
"That the penalty is due primarily as expiation to God in justice, and only secondarily to man has been lost sight of altogether.
",-1
"This first appeared in The Remnant nearly 20 years ago.
",-1
"Isn't it time to subscribe to the 'paper of record' for the traditional Catholic counterrevolution?
",-1
"The source of this kind of materialistic thinking in the Church is not hard to trace.
",-1
"According to statistics published in the National Review for September 16, 1983, out of 9,140 murders committed in the U.S. in 1960 just before the Council, 56 persons were executed.
",-1
"In 1965, the year the Council closed, although the tally of murders had risen to 9,850, only 7 were executed.
",-1
"In the decade from 1967 to 1977 a moratorium was declared during which not one single execution took place.
",-1
"At its close the number of murders had more than doubled, and in any six month period, more Americans were being murdered than those executed during the whole course of the century.
",-1
"Whether or not the U. S. will follow suit and outlaw it nationally still remains to be seen.
",-1
"In modern times, which find the Church strictly separated from the state on principle and denied any active part in civil government, secularism has become the state religion, directing legislation exclusively to temporal objectives.
",-1
"It is only to be expected that materialists—for whom the immortal soul does not exist and who believe that this present life of the senses on earth is the only one man has—should be reluctant to punish anyone by killing him.
",-1
"In the days of Christendom, condemned criminals were given every opportunity to make their peace with God, in many cases the date of execution being delayed in order to accomplish this purpose.
",-1
"Justice was served, but not at the expense of charity, and there was no question of taking vengeance on the culprit.
",-1
"Nor was the idea of “rehabilitation” with possible re-entry into society ever entertained where crimes deserving death were concerned.
",-1
"It has been noted by prison chaplains in our century that swift execution in most cases leads to admission of guilt and sincere repentance, whereas those who receive life sentences or suffer long delays are likely to maintain their innocence in hopes of a parole and eventually die in their sins.
",-1
"If his contrition is perfect, it’s conceivable that he could go straight to heaven!
",-1
"In any case, neither he nor society is any longer burdened with the guilt of his wrongdoing.
",-1
"+++
",-1
"As we have seen, the death penalty has a very long history.
",-1
"When God set the death penalty in Eden He pronounced it on Himself, to be carried out in the fullness of time through the malicious free wills of his own creatures.
",-1
"The Cross which was its instrument is the very sign of Christianity, the only means of salvation.
",-1
"Not even from the Cross did Christ decry the death penalty, either for himself or for the two thieves crucified with Him.
",-1
"28:18) after His Resurrection.
",-1
"As He told Pontius Pilate at the time of His trial, “Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above” (John 19:10).
",-1
"Pope Leo XIII re-affirmed this truth in Sapientiae Christianae in 1890, when he declared that “true and legitimate authority is devoid of sanction unless it proceed from God the supreme Ruler and Lord of all.
",-1
"The Almighty alone can commit power to a man over his fellow men.” Even though they may be unaware of the true source of their power, it is always the duty of legitimate authorities to ensure public order by punishing evil-doers, by death if appropriate.
",-1
"As St. Paul said:
",-1
"Therefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist purchase to themselves eternal damnation.
",-1
"For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil.
",-1
"But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain.
",-1
"13:2-4).
",-1
"A share in making restitution for sin was thus accorded to all of us, for although our Lord’s ignominious death removed from us the guilt of the original transgression through Baptism, it did not remove its effects.
",-1
"What Christ did was to sanctify the death penalty, transforming it into a sacrament of life for those who believe.
",-1
"As St. Paul declared, “Death is swallowed up in victory.
",-1
"O death, where is thy victory?
",-1
"O death, where is thy sting?.
",-1
"For by a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of the dead.
",-1
"And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive” (1 Cor.
",-1
"15: 54-55; 21-22).
",-1
"The first of that numberless host of Christian martyrs who would be put to death by constituted authority for testifying to the truth, Christ commanded His disciples to “Follow me!” Inviting all to Calvary to “suffer under Pontius Pilate” with Him, He granted a meritorious share in accomplishing “the mystery which hath been hidden for ages and generations, but is now made manifest to his saints” to all who, like St. Paul, would “now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up those things which are wanting of the sufferings of Christ in my flesh, for his body which is the church.

",-1
"Criminals put to death undergo a penalty no different from the one exacted from the most innocent amongst us.

"DB: John, what is the latest we know about how Julian Assange is being treated and his current state?
",-1
"John Pilger: His state of health is just about the same, as I understand it.

"He needs medical attention, the kind of treatment you get only in a hospital.
",-1
"But it has been made clear to him that if he attempts to go to a hospital he will not be given free passage and he will be arrested.
",-1
"Since he was arrested in 2010, Assange has not been charged with a single crime.
",-1
"My own feeling is that there is a great deal of collusion between the Australian, the British and the US governments–meant to close down WikiLeaks completely and/or deliver Julian Assange to the Americans.
",-1
"Recently the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, traveled with senior officials to London and to Washington and raised the whole matter of Julian.
",-1
"But they raised it in a way that didn’t support the idea that a government should represent its citizens.
",-1
"These people listened to the more powerful governments.
",-1
"In Washington they met Mr. Pompeo, who refused to discuss Assange altogether.
",-1
"I think there is collusion which amounts to an attempt to try to do a deal with Assange whereby he might be allowed free passage of return to Australia if he shuts down WikiLeaks.

",-1
"Archbishop Bernard Hebda of St. Paul, MN, responds to the McCarrick scandal (The Catholic Spirit):
",-1
"The matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that I had served in the Archdiocese of Newark as coadjutor archbishop from November 4, 2013, to March 25, 2016, when I was named archbishop here.
",-1
"It was while I was in Newark that I was introduced to then-Cardinal McCarrick.
",-1
"I can state unequivocally that I learned of those settlements only in June of this year, as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the Archdiocese of New York.
",-1
"What I know of the settlements I know from the newspapers.
",-1
"When serving in Newark, I was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts, but not on past legal matters (unless they were still being discussed in the press).
",-1
"It would be untrue to state that I had never heard any allegations about Cardinal McCarrick.
",-1
"While the complaint didn’t supply any details, the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that “Archbishop McCarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them.” The complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation.
",-1
"Knowing, however, that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts, I never gave the particular allegation about Cardinal McCarrick any credence.
",-1
"I can also state without exception that no one in my years in Newark ever told me that they were improperly touched by Archbishop McCarrick, and no one ever told me that they had to share a bed with him or that they had seen anyone share a bed with him.
",-1
"When I was installed here in St. Paul, he joined me at lunch along with my father, sister, godmother and then 12-year-old nephew.
",-1
"I can assure you that I would never have allowed that to happen if I had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month.
",-1
"I was grateful for the opportunity to reinforce that with our seminarians this past weekend, and I look forward to continuing my work with the Office of Ministerial Standards and Safe Environment, and our Archdiocesan Review Board, in creating a culture in which no one need be afraid or reluctant to bring forth an allegation of misconduct.
",-1
"In fact, this binding and constant teaching of the Church was reaffirmed most recently in her most authoritative modern catechism, which holds the exact opposite position from that apparently held by many bishops:
",-1
"Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex... Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.""
",-1
"They are contrary to the natural law.
",-1
"They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity.
",-1
"Under no circumstances can they be approved.
",-1
"(Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357)
",-1
"Although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.
",-1
"Therefore special concern and pastoral attention should be directed to those who have this condition, lest they be led to believe that the living out of this orientation in homosexual activity is a morally acceptable option.
",-1
"It is not.
",-1
"Does His Excellency believe that if some homosexual Catholics feel they need not bother following the rules they should be warmly welcomed into our ""Catholic Christian"" community anyway, even if they are in same-sex unions?

",-1
"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday released a sweeping grand jury report on sex abuse in the Catholic Church, listing hundreds of accused clergy and detailing 70 years of misconduct and church response across the state.
",-1
"The release is the culmination of an 18-month probe, led by state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, on six of the state’s eight dioceses — Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Allentown, Scranton, Erie and Greensburg — and follows other state grand jury reports that revealed abuse and coverups in two other dioceses.
",-1
"Some details and names that might reveal the 300 clergy listed have been redacted from the report.
",-1
"Legal challenges by clergy delayed the report’s release, after some said it is a violation of their constitutional rights.
",-1
"Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court ruled last month that the report must be released but with some redaction.
",-1
"Both have further polarized the church on homosexuality, celibacy and whether laypeople should have more power.

"It has also triggered debate about whether statutes of limitations should be expanded.

"The reality of sin — even sin in the Church — is nothing new.
",-1
"We are a Church made of sinners, but we are sinners called to sanctity.
",-1
"So what is new?
",-1
"What is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church, and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others.
",-1
"In our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
",-1
"In order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation.
",-1
"Why do we do this?
",-1
"Is it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being “pastoral?” Have we covered over the truth out of fear?
",-1
"Are we afraid of being disliked by people in this world?
",-1
"Or are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives?
",-1
"Perhaps these are the reasons, but perhaps it is more or less complex than this.
",-1
"In the end, the excuses do not matter.
",-1
"We must be done with sin.
",-1
"It must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable.
",-1
"Love sinners?
",-1
"Accept true repentance?
",-1
"But do not say sin is okay.
",-1
"And do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave, lasting consequences.
",-1
"For the Church, the crisis we face is not limited to the McCarrick affair, or the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, or anything else that may come.
",-1
"There is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching, our preaching, our decision making, and our very way of living.
",-1
"As the Book of Proverbs says “My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov.
",-1
"There must be no room left, no refuge for sin — either within our own lives, or within the lives of our communities.
",-1
"To be a refuge for sinners (which we should be), the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled.
",-1
"In this I speak of all sin.
",-1
"To call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further.
",-1
"That is to say, until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia — this despite clear evidence to the contrary.
",-1
"It is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more.
",-1
"To fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable — neither the abuse of children, nor any use of one’s sexuality outside of the marital relationship, nor the sin of sodomy, nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all, nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority.
",-1
"The Church’s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful, but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest.
",-1
"Christian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness.
",-1
"But while hating the sin, we must never hate the sinner, who is called to conversion, penance, and renewed communion with Christ and His Church, through His inexhaustible mercy.
",-1
"At the same time, however, the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense.
",-1
"Motivated, therefore, by love and concern for souls, I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty.
",-1
"The result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ’s name.
",-1
"It causes others to sin in their thoughts, words, and deeds — which is the very definition of scandal.
",-1
"And the second mistrust harms the future of the Church, since our future priests are at stake.
",-1
"I said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this.
",-1
"However, that temptation quickly passed, thanks be to God.
",-1
"No matter how large the problem, we know that we are called to go forward in faith, to rely upon God’s promises to us, and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can, within our spheres of influence.
",-1
"I have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters, and I have begun to, and will continue to, talk with the priests of the diocese, as well as the faithful, in person and through my weekly column and homilies, making things as clear as I can, from my perspective.
",-1
"Here now, I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese:
",-1
"In the first place, we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese.
",-1
"This is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance, nor our efforts to improve.
",-1
"We must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented, requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry, as well as across-the-board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals.
",-1
"Here again, I state, as we have done consistently, if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church, contact law enforcement.
",-1
"If you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources.
",-1
"If you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood, we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first, but even if you don’t want to, please still reach out to us.
",-1
"To our seminarians: If you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me and to the seminary rector.
",-1
"To our priests: Most simply, live out the promises you made on your ordination day.
",-1
"You are called to serve Christ’s people, beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours.
",-1
"This is to keep you very close to God.
",-1
"In addition, you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop.
",-1
"And by extension, live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ, the Church, and the people whom he has called you to serve.
",-1
"God will give you the graces to do so.
",-1
"Ask Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day.
",-1
"And if you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me.
",-1
"To the faithful of the diocese: If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest, bishop, cardinal, or any employee of the Church, bring it forward.
",-1
"It will be addressed quickly and justly.
",-1
"If you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse, bring it forward as well.
",-1
"Furthermore, I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate, priesthood, our parishes, schools, universities, and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would-be sexual predator or accomplice;
",-1
"I will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish, and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed;
",-1
"I will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood.
",-1
"I will continue to require (with our men and our funds) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests, in the image of Christ;
",-1
"I ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities, the faithful in the pews, and to God Almighty, not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church, but our seminarians, university students, and all the faithful as well.
",-1
"I promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest, or any Church employee, guilty of abuse;
",-1
"I ask everyone reading this to pray.
",-1
"Finally, I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy.
",-1
"Some sins, like some demons, can only be driven out by prayer and fasting.
",-1
"More than anything else, we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil.
",-1
"We must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors — myself included — that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness.
",-1
"We must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth.
",-1
"Again, right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country, calling for real reform and “house cleaning” of this type of depravity.
",-1
"I stand with them.
",-1

"The emerging homosexual clergy scandal is just beginning to unfold.

"Many in the hierarchy were active homosexuals who intentionally relaxed and ignored the Church’s teaching and moral stance on homosexuality.

"According to the Vatican, the chosen topic of the 2018 Synod, is an “expression of the Church’s pastoral concern for the young,” and is in continuity with the findings of the two-fold synod on the family and Francis’s post-synodal document Amoris Laetitia.

"Pope admits Catholic Church has ‘long ignored’ problem of child abuse
",-1
"VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Monday asked forgiveness for child abuse crimes and cover-ups within the Catholic Church, admitting that the pain of victims “was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced.”
",-1
"The report “detailed the experiences of at least a thousand survivors, victims of sexual abuse, the abuse of power and of conscience at the hands of priests over a period of approximately seventy years,” Francis acknowledged.
",-1
"“Let us beg forgiveness for our own sins and the sins of others,” he added.
",-1
"In the run-up to Francis’ visit to Ireland, the head of the Irish Catholic Church, Archbishop Eamon Martin, said he expected the pope to meet with victims of clergy sex abuse and to promise effective remedies.
",-1
"“With shame and repentance, we acknowledge as an ecclesial community that we were not where we should have been, that we did not act in a timely manner, realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives.
",-1
"We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them,” Francis said.
",-1
"Looking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated,” he added.
",-1
"Colm O’Gorman, an Irish abuse survivor who founded One in Four, the main survivors’ group in Ireland, commented on Twitter that the pope offered “Much stronger language than ever used before.”
",-1
"In January, the pope was accused of insensitivity and tone-deafness after insisting, during a visit to Chile, that local abuse survivors had no “proof” against a bishop who allegedly witnessed abuse and failed to report it.
",-1
"According to church expert John L Allen, an editor at specialized website Crux.com, the Catholic Church has a structural problem when it comes to dealing with cover up accusations.
",-1
"“Sixteen years since the crisis first erupted in the U.S., almost ten years since that happened in Ireland, and now more than five years since Francis was elected, the Catholic Church still has no credible, transparent process for handling cases when the accusation against a bishop isn’t the direct commission of abuse but rather covering up someone else’s crimes,” Allen said in a Sunday column.

"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

"And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.

"And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.

"And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.
",-1
"And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there.
",-1
"And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.
",-1
"And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there.
",-1
"And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
",-1
"And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto theLord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there.

"Lot met the angels in the city square and urged them to stay at his house.
",-1
"The angels agreed.
",-1
"The Bible then informs us, ""Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom — both young and old — surrounded the house.
",-1
"They called to Lot, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight?
",-1
"Genesis 19:4-5 The angels then proceed to blind all the men of Sodom and Gomorrah and urge Lot and his family to flee from the cities to escape the wrath that God was about to deliver.
",-1
"Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities..."" (Genesis 19:2 4) .
",-1
"In light of the passage, the most common response to the question, ""What was the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah?""
",-1
"is that it was homosexuality.
",-1
"That is how the term ”sodomy” came to be used to refer to anal sex between two men, whether consensual or forced.
",-1
"Clearly, homosexuality was part of the reason God destroyed the two cities.
",-1
"At the same time, it is not biblical to say that homosexuality was the exclusive reason why God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
",-1
"The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were definitely not exclusive in terms of the sins in which they indulged.
",-1
"Ezekiel 16:49-50 declares, ""Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.
",-1
"So, again, while homosexuality was not the only sin in which the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah indulged, it does appear to be the primary reason for the destruction of the cities.
",-1
"Those who attempt to explain away the biblical condemnations of homosexuality claim that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was inhospitality.
",-1
"The men of Sodom and Gomorrah were certainly being inhospitable.
",-1
"But to say God completely destroyed two cities and all their inhabitants for being inhospitable clearly misses the point.

",-1
"Instead of establishing judgment within the gate and hating the evil and loving the good (Amos 5:15) in hopes that the Lord may be gracious to their repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10), they reject the counsel of God against them by hating the good and loving the evil, and that to their own damnation.
",-1
"They wear the cross.
",-1
"Yet, they have no testimony of the power of God unto salvation by the cross because they do not practice what Christ required: “Deny yourselves and take up your cross and follow Me” (Matthew 16:24; Romans 1:16; 2 Corinthians 5:15, 13:4-5; Galatians 2:21).

"As St Pope John XXIII explained, “Its principal task will be concerned with the conditions and modernization of the Church after 20 centuries of life.” It was not supposed (as some have claimed) to simply update the liturgy from its last redesign in 1570.
",-1
"The goal was to align the Church more with modern world: a world defined, to a considerable extent, by its rejection of the Catholic world that flourished before the Protestant Reformation and French Revolution.
",-1
"Now, I don’t believe Pope John saw himself as endangering either orthodoxy or sacred, immutable tradition.
",-1
"I share Pope Paul IV’s view.
",-1
"Nonetheless, he stirred it.
",-1
"The spirit of aggiornamento quickly spread through the Church in the 1960s – and the seminaries especially.
",-1
"Seminarians called for a more “participatory” administration.
",-1
"They became involved in socialist politics.
",-1
"They formed trade unions to demand the right to marry.
",-1
"They practiced sauvage intercommunion.
",-1
"Of course, they had their enablers in the hierarchy as well.
",-1
"Perhaps the worst was Archbishop Marty of Paris, a leader of the “priest-worker movement” who defended Marxist and existentialist atheisms on the floor of the Council.
",-1
"During a homily at the Cathedral, he also praised the soixantehuitards: “the great outburst of the younger generation that suddenly wanted to take its place in life” that occurred in his city in May of 1968.
",-1
"“One also felt that, in these events of May,” Marty continued, “the seriousness of the working class, which wants not only to earn a living wage, but also to find its freedom, its independence.” Theaggiornamentistas was never purged from the Church, and certainly not from the seminaries.
",-1
"As the modern world continued to reject traditional Christian mores, so too does the Church seem increasingly “out of step” and in need of “modernizing”.
",-1
"Inevitably, this came to mean the acceptance of homosexuality.
",-1
"Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, infamously spoke of “an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.”
",-1
"But that predominance has very little to do with homosexuality per se.
",-1
"Rather, the 1960s rejection of celibacy in the seminaries naturally provided more (shall we say) opportunities for gay men – given that there are, of course, no women in Catholic seminaries.
",-1
"This began driving away heterosexuals, as well as homosexuals who upheld the Church’s teachings on chastity and celibacy.
",-1
"But the toleration of sexually active priests gave McCarrick cover to “seduce” his victims.
",-1
"Many have also speculated that, because McCarrick’s victims were overwhelmingly above the age of consent, the media didn’t consider them newsworthy.
",-1
"If he’d fondled a 12-year old altar boy, that would have been one thing.
",-1
"But taking an 18-year-old seminarian to bed?
",-1
"Meanwhile, those bishops who didn’t approve of his actions knew the culture – both within the Church and without her – were against them.
",-1
"The post-Vatican Church doesn’t like to come off as a nag.
",-1
"She’s not going to cause a fuss by purging sexually active gay men from the clergy just because… what?
",-1
"It’s immoral?
",-1
"That’s not very aggiornamentistic!
",-1
"The world and our worldly bishops were, unsurprisingly, of one mind.
",-1
"And even if they were disgusted by McCarrick, these prelates weren’t willing to jeopardize their careers by standing for justice against vice.
",-1
"We seem to be slouching back to the old traditionalist trope: All the Church’s problems would be solved if we’d just go back to the Latin Mass.
",-1
"And we can’t drag the Church out of her present crisis until we have the courage to brave accusations of “Lefebvrism” and say so.
",-1
"It isn’t.
",-1
"Its obsession with “modernization” leads it to only adopt the vices of modernity.
",-1
"Instead of serving as ambassadors from the City of God, far too many of our priests and prelates have become agents of the City of Man.
",-1
"I don’t know what it will take to set things right.
",-1
"Christ promised.

"Former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States Accuses Pope of McCarrick Cover-up, Calls on Francis to Resign
",-1
"I am thinking in particular of the United States of America, where I was sent as Apostolic Nuncio by Pope Benedict XVI on October 19, 2011, the memorial feast of the First North American Martyrs.
",-1
"The Bishops of the United States are called, and I with them, to follow the example of these first martyrs who brought the Gospel to the lands of America, to be credible witnesses of the immeasurable love of Christ, the Way, the Truth and the Life.
",-1
"May God save His Church MJM
",-1
"So serious is the cover-up that for the good of the Church and protection of the faithful, Archbishop Vigano has called on Pope Francis to resign.
",-1
"But before Francis resigns, we the Catholic faithful demand that he also remove from the College of Cardinals those who conspired even before the 2013 conclave to make Jorge Mario Bergoglio pope come hell or high water.
",-1
"He and the St. Gallen Group know exactly who they are.
",-1
"Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò's 11-page statement, released to the National Catholic Register, accuses Pope Francis of covering for McCarrick, ignoring the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on McCarrick, and also of making McCarrick a trusted counselor who became Francis's ""kingmaker"" when it came to American appointments and was highly instrumental in the Pope's decision to elevate far-Left bishops such as Blase Cupich of Chicago and Joseph Tobin of Newark to the College of Cardinals.
",-1
"The former apostolic nuncio to the United States has accused Francis of repealing sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI on then-Cardinal McCarrick for sexual abuse.
",-1
"“Whatever you have said in the dark ... shall be proclaimed from the housetops” (Lk.
",-1
"12:3).
",-1
"I had always believed and hoped that the hierarchy of the Church could find within itself the spiritual resources and strength to tell the whole truth, to amend and to renew itself.
",-1
"That is why, even though I had repeatedly been asked to do so, I always avoided making statements to the media, even when it would have been my right to do so, in order to defend myself against the calumnies published about me, even by high-ranking prelates of the Roman Curia.
",-1
"But now that the corruption has reached the very top of the Church’s hierarchy, my conscience dictates that I reveal those truths regarding the heart-breaking case of the Archbishop Emeritus of Washington, D.C., Theodore McCarrick, which I came to know in the course of the duties entrusted to me by St. John Paul II, as Delegate for Pontifical Representations, from 1998 to 2009, and by Pope Benedict XVI, as Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America, from October 19, 2011 until end of May 2016.
",-1
"As Delegate for Pontifical Representations in the Secretariat of State, my responsibilities were not limited to the Apostolic Nunciatures, but also included the staff of the Roman Curia (hires, promotions, informational processes on candidates to the episcopate, etc.)
",-1
"and the examination of delicate cases, including those regarding cardinals and bishops, that were entrusted to the Delegate by the Cardinal Secretary of State or by the Substitute of the Secretariat of State.
",-1
"Indeed, according to what Nuncio Pietro Sambi wrote, Father Boniface Ramsey, O.P.’s letter, dated November 22, 2000, was written at the request of the late Nuncio Montalvo.
",-1
"In the letter, Father Ramsey, who had been a professor at the diocesan seminary in Newark from the end of the ’80s until 1996, affirms that there was a recurring rumor in the seminary that the Archbishop “shared his bed with seminarians,” inviting five at a time to spend the weekend with him at his beach house.
",-1
"And he added that he knew a certain number of seminarians, some of whom were later ordained priests for the Archdiocese of Newark, who had been invited to this beach house and had shared a bed with the Archbishop.
",-1
"The office that I held at the time was not informed of any measure taken by the Holy See after those charges were brought by Nuncio Montalvo at the end of 2000, when Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State.
",-1
"The Nuncio added that Littleton had already forwarded his Memorandum to about twenty people, including civil and ecclesiastical judicial authorities, police and lawyers, in June 2006, and that it was therefore very likely that the news would soon be made public.
",-1
"He therefore called for a prompt intervention by the Holy See.
",-1
"In my memo, which I delivered on that same December 6, 2006 to my direct superior, the Substitute Leonardo Sandri, I proposed the following considerations and course of action to my superiors:
",-1
"- Given that it seemed a new scandal of particular gravity, as it regarded a cardinal, was going to be added to the many scandals for the Church in the United States,
",-1
"- and that, since this matter had to do with a cardinal, and according to can.
",-1
"1405 § 1, No.
",-1
"2˚, “ipsius Romani Pontificis dumtaxat ius est iudicandi”;
",-1
"- I proposed that an exemplary measure be taken against the Cardinal that could have a medicinal function, to prevent future abuses against innocent victims and alleviate the very serious scandal for the faithful, who despite everything continued to love and believe in the Church.
",-1
"I added that it would be salutary if, for once, ecclesiastical authority would intervene before the civil authorities and, if possible, before the scandal had broken out in the press.
",-1
"This could have restored some dignity to a Church so sorely tried and humiliated by so many abominable acts on the part of some pastors.
",-1
"My memo of December 6, 2006 was kept by my superiors, and was never returned to me with any actual decision by the superiors on this matter.
",-1
"Subsequently, around April 21-23, 2008, the Statement for Pope Benedict XVI about the pattern of sexual abuse crisis in the United States, by Richard Sipe, was published on the internet, at richardsipe.com.
",-1
"On April 24, it was passed on by the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal William Levada, to the Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone.
",-1
"It was delivered to me one month later, on May 24, 2008.
",-1
"The following day, I delivered a new memo to the new Substitute, Fernando Filoni, which included my previous one of December 6, 2006.
",-1
"In it, I summarized Richard Sipe’s document, which ended with this respectful and heartfelt appeal to Pope Benedict XVI: “I approach Your Holiness with due reverence, but with the same intensity that motivated Peter Damian to lay out before your predecessor, Pope Leo IX, a description of the condition of the clergy during his time.
",-1
"The problems he spoke of are similar and as great now in the United States as they were then in Rome.
",-1
"If Your Holiness requests, I will personally submit to you documentation of that about which I have spoken.”
",-1
"I ended my memo by repeating to my superiors that I thought it was necessary to intervene as soon as possible by removing the cardinal’s hat from Cardinal McCarrick and that he should be subjected to the sanctions established by the Code of Canon Law, which also provide for reduction to the lay state.
",-1
"Pope Benedict had imposed on Cardinal McCarrick sanctions similar to those now imposed on him by Pope Francis: the Cardinal was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.
",-1
"I certainly do not believe it was Pope Benedict, who as Cardinal had repeatedly denounced the corruption present in the Church, and in the first months of his pontificate had already taken a firm stand against the admission into seminary of young men with deep homosexual tendencies.
",-1
"I believe it was due to the Pope’s first collaborator at the time, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who notoriously favored promoting homosexuals into positions of responsibility, and was accustomed to managing the information he thought appropriate to convey to the Pope.
",-1
"In any case, what is certain is that Pope Benedict imposed the above canonical sanctions on McCarrick and that they were communicated to him by the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi.
",-1
"Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, then first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington and Chargé d'Affaires a.i.
",-1
"after the unexpected death of Nuncio Sambi in Baltimore, told me when I arrived in Washington — and he is ready to testify to it— about a stormy conversation, lasting over an hour, that Nuncio Sambi had with Cardinal McCarrick whom he had summoned to the Nunciature.
",-1
"Monsignor Lantheaume told me that “the Nuncio’s voice could be heard all the way out in the corridor.”
",-1
"Pope Benedict’s same dispositions were then also communicated to me by the new Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Marc Ouellet, in November 2011, in a conversation before my departure for Washington, and were included among the instructions of the same Congregation to the new Nuncio.
",-1
"In turn, I repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature.
",-1
"The Cardinal, muttering in a barely comprehensible way, admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance.
",-1
"It is therefore my duty to reveal what I know about this, beginning with the Roman Curia.
",-1
"Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information was communicated to him.
",-1
"In November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick.
",-1
"It is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end.
",-1
"He even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up.
",-1
"Sodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed.
",-1
"Benedict reacted, despite Sodano’s strenuous defense, and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned.
",-1
"Was McCarrick’s appointment to Washington and as Cardinal the work of Sodano, when John Paul II was already very ill?
",-1
"We are not given to know.
",-1
"However, it is legitimate to think so, but I do not think he was the only one responsible for this.
",-1
"McCarrick frequently went to Rome and made friends everywhere, at all levels of the Curia.
",-1
"If Sodano had protected Maciel, as seems certain, there is no reason why he wouldn’t have done so for McCarrick, who according to many had the financial means to influence decisions.
",-1
"His nomination to Washington was opposed by then-Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.
",-1
"At the Nunciature in Washington there is a note, written in his hand, in which Cardinal Re disassociates himself from the appointment and states that McCarrick was 14th on the list for Washington.
",-1
"Nuncio Sambi’s report, with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State.
",-1
"My two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute.
",-1
"As already mentioned, the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals — I cite only the well-known case of Vincenzo de Mauro, who was appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians — and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict.
",-1
"Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the current Secretary of State, was also complicit in covering up the misdeeds of McCarrick who had, after the election of Pope Francis, boasted openly of his travels and missions to various continents.
",-1
"In April 2014, the Washington Times had a front page report on McCarrick’s trip to the Central African Republic, and on behalf of the State Department no less.
",-1
"As Nuncio to Washington, I wrote to Cardinal Parolin asking him if the sanctions imposed on McCarrick by Pope Benedict were still valid.
",-1
"Ça va sans dire that my letter never received any reply!
",-1
"The same can be said for Cardinal William Levada, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, for Cardinals Marc Ouellet, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Lorenzo Baldisseri, former Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops, and Archbishop Ilson de Jesus Montanari, current Secretary of the same Congregation.
",-1
"They were all aware by reason of their office of the sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict on McCarrick.
",-1
"Cardinals Leonardo Sandri, Fernando Filoni and Angelo Becciu, as Substitutes of the Secretariat of State, knew in every detail the situation regarding Cardinal McCarrick.
",-1
"Nor could Cardinals Giovanni Lajolo and Dominique Mamberti have failed to know.
",-1
"As Secretaries for Relations with States, they participated several times a week in collegial meetings with the Secretary of State.
",-1
"As far as the Roman Curia is concerned, for the moment I will stop here, even if the names of other prelates in the Vatican are well known, even some very close to Pope Francis, such as Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio and Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, who belong to the homosexual current in favor of subverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality, a current already denounced in 1986 by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then-Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in the Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons.
",-1
"Cardinals Edwin Frederick O’Brien and Renato Raffaele Martino also belong to the same current, albeit with a different ideology.
",-1
"Others belonging to this current even reside at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.
",-1
"Now to the United States.
",-1
"Obviously, the first to have been informed of the measures taken by Pope Benedict was McCarrick’s successor in Washington See, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, whose situation is now completely compromised by the recent revelations regarding his behavior as Bishop of Pittsburgh.
",-1
"It is absolutely unthinkable that Nunzio Sambi, who was an extremely responsible person, loyal, direct and explicit in his way of being (a true son of Romagna) did not speak to him about it.
",-1
"In any case, I myself brought up the subject with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn’t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it.
",-1
"I also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick.
",-1
"I immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it.
",-1
"If, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained?
",-1
"Cardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion.
",-1
"Following a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters.
",-1
"Before forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written.
",-1
"The Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it.
",-1
"However, he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters, contrary to what he customarily did.
",-1
"I subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years.
",-1
"But the Cardinal knew nothing about it!
",-1
"Cardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope’s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C.
",-1
"In doing so, he put other seminarians at risk.
",-1
"Bishop Paul Bootkoski, emeritus of Metuchen, and Archbishop John Myers, emeritus of Newark, covered up the abuses committed by McCarrick in their respective dioceses and compensated two of his victims.
",-1
"They cannot deny it and they must be interrogated in order to reveal every circumstance and all responsibility regarding this matter.
",-1
"Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who was recently interviewed by the media, also said that he didn’t have the slightest idea about the abuses committed by McCarrick.
",-1
"Given his tenure in Washington, Dallas and now Rome, I think no one can honestly believe him.
",-1
"I don’t know if he was ever asked if he knew about Maciel’s crimes.
",-1
"If he were to deny this, would anybody believe him given that he occupied positions of responsibility as a member of the Legionaries of Christ?
",-1
"In the last months of his pontificate, Pope Benedict XVI had convened a meeting of all the apostolic nuncios in Rome, as Paul VI and St. John Paul II had done on several occasions.
",-1
"The date set for the audience with the Pope was Friday, June 21, 2013.
",-1
"Pope Francis kept this commitment made by his predecessor.
",-1
"Of course I also came to Rome from Washington.
",-1
"It was my first meeting with the new Pope elected only three months prior, after the resignation of Pope Benedict.
",-1
"On the morning of Thursday, June 20, 2013, I went to the Domus Sanctae Marthae, to join my colleagues who were staying there.
",-1
"As soon as I entered the hall I met Cardinal McCarrick, who wore the red-trimmed cassock.
",-1
"I greeted him respectfully as I had always done.
",-1
"He immediately said to me, in a tone somewhere between ambiguous and triumphant: “The Pope received me yesterday, tomorrow I am going to China.”
",-1
"At the time I knew nothing of his long friendship with Cardinal Bergoglio and of the important part he had played in his recent election, as McCarrick himself would later reveal in a lecture at Villanova University and in an interview with the National Catholic Reporter.
",-1
"Nor had I ever thought of the fact that he had participated in the preliminary meetings of the recent conclave, and of the role he had been able to have as a cardinal elector in the 2005 conclave.
",-1
"Therefore I did not immediately grasp the meaning of the encrypted message that McCarrick had communicated to me, but that would become clear to me in the days immediately following.
",-1
"The next day the audience with Pope Francis took place.
",-1
"After his address, which was partly read and partly delivered off the cuff, the Pope wished to greet all the nuncios one by one.
",-1
"In single file, I remember that I was among the last.
",-1
"When it was my turn, I just had time to say to him, “I am the Nuncio to the United States.” He immediately assailed me with a tone of reproach, using these words: “The Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized!
",-1
"I had in my hand a book in Portuguese that Cardinal O’Malley had sent me for the Pope a few days earlier, telling me “so he could go over his Portuguese before going to Rio for World Youth Day.” I handed it to him immediately, and so freed myself from that extremely disconcerting and embarrassing situation.
",-1
"At the end of the audience the Pope announced: “Those of you who are still in Rome next Sunday are invited to concelebrate with me at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.” I naturally thought of staying on to clarify as soon as possible what the Pope intended to tell me.
",-1
"On Sunday June 23, before the concelebration with the Pope, I asked Monsignor Ricca, who as the person in charge of the house helped us put on the vestments, if he could ask the Pope if he could receive me sometime in the following week.
",-1
"How could I have returned to Washington without having clarified what the Pope wanted of me?
",-1
"At the end of Mass, while the Pope was greeting the few lay people present, Monsignor Fabian Pedacchio, his Argentine secretary, came to me and said: “The Pope told me to ask if you are free now!” Naturally, I replied that I was at the Pope’s disposal and that I thanked him for receiving me immediately.
",-1
"The Pope took me to the first floor in his apartment and said: “We have 40 minutes before the Angelus.”
",-1
"I began the conversation, asking the Pope what he intended to say to me with the words he had addressed to me when I greeted him the previous Friday.
",-1
"And the Pope, in a very different, friendly, almost affectionate tone, said to me: “Yes, the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing like the Archbishop of Philadelphia, (the Pope did not give me the name of the Archbishop) they must be shepherds; and they must not be left-wing — and he added, raising both arms — and when I say left-wing I mean homosexual.” Of course, the logic of the correlation between being left-wing and being homosexual escaped me, but I added nothing else.
",-1
"Immediately after, the Pope asked me in a deceitful way: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” I answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naiveté: “Holy Father, I don’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him.
",-1
"But then, what was the Pope’s purpose in asking me that question: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not.
",-1
"Back in Washington everything became very clear to me, thanks also to a new event that occurred only a few days after my meeting with Pope Francis.
",-1
"When the new Bishop Mark Seitz took possession of the Diocese of El Paso on July 9, 2013, I sent the first Counsellor, Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, while I went to Dallas that same day for an international meeting on Bioethics.
",-1
"When he got back, Monsignor Lantheaume told me that in El Paso he had met Cardinal McCarrick who, taking him aside, told him almost the same words that the Pope had said to me in Rome: “the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing, they must be shepherds….” I was astounded!
",-1
"It was therefore clear that the words of reproach that Pope Francis had addressed to me on June 21, 2013 had been put into his mouth the day before by Cardinal McCarrick.
",-1
"Also the Pope’s mention “not like the Archbishop of Philadelphia” could be traced to McCarrick, because there had been a strong disagreement between the two of them about the admission to Communion of pro-abortion politicians.
",-1
"In his communication to the bishops, McCarrick had manipulated a letter of then-Cardinal Ratzinger who prohibited giving them Communion.
",-1
"Indeed, I also knew how certain Cardinals such as Mahony, Levada and Wuerl, were closely linked to McCarrick; they had opposed the most recent appointments made by Pope Benedict, for important posts such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, Denver and San Francisco.
",-1
"Not happy with the trap he had set for me on June 23, 2013, when he asked me about McCarrick, only a few months later, in the audience he granted me on October 10, 2013, Pope Francis set a second one for me, this time concerning a second of his protégés, Cardinal Donald Wuerl.
",-1
"Once again the Pope did not show any reaction.
",-1
"It was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis’s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews.
",-1
"In a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, he had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States, and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration.
",-1
"This is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal.
",-1
"With these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops.
",-1
"In addition, he appointed the Brazilian Ilson de Jesus Montanari — the great friend of his private Argentine secretary Fabian Pedacchio — as Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops and Secretary of the College of Cardinals, promoting him in one single leap from a simple official of that department to Archbishop Secretary.
",-1
"Their names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.
",-1
"During the speech he gave when he took possession of the Chicago See, at which I was present as a representative of the Pope, Cupich quipped that one certainly should not expect the new Archbishop to walk on water.
",-1
"Perhaps it would be enough for him to be able to remain with his feet on the ground and not try to turn reality upside-down, blinded by his pro-gay ideology, as he stated in a recent interview with America Magazine.
",-1
"Extolling his particular expertise in the matter, having been President of the Committee on Protection of Children and Young People of the USCCB, he asserted that the main problem in the crisis of sexual abuse by clergy is not homosexuality, and that affirming this is only a way of diverting attention from the real problem which is clericalism.
",-1
"In support of this thesis, Cupich “oddly” made reference to the results of research carried out at the height of the sexual abuse of minors crisis in the early 2000s, while he “candidly” ignored that the results of that investigation were totally denied by the subsequent Independent Reports by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in 2004 and 2011, which concluded that, in cases of sexual abuse, 81% of the victims were male.
",-1
"In fact, Father Hans Zollner, S.J., Vice-Rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University, President of the Centre for Child Protection, and Member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, recently told the newspaper La Stampa that “in most cases it is a question of homosexual abuse.”
",-1
"The appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above, with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio, by Cardinal Parolin: “Reserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.” McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick’s abuses, as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28, 2016.
",-1
"These characters are closely associated with individuals belonging in particular to the deviated wing of the Society of Jesus, unfortunately today a majority, which had already been a cause of serious concern to Paul VI and subsequent pontiffs.
",-1
"We need only consider Father Robert Drinan, S.J., who was elected four times to the House of Representatives, and was a staunch supporter of abortion; or Father Vincent O’Keefe, S.J., one of the principal promoters of The Land O’Lakes Statement of 1967, which seriously compromised the Catholic identity of universities and colleges in the United States.
",-1
"It should be noted that McCarrick, then President of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, also participated in that inauspicious undertaking which was so harmful to the formation of the consciences of American youth, closely associated as it was with the deviated wing of the Jesuits.
",-1
"Father James Martin, S.J., acclaimed by the people mentioned above, in particular Cupich, Tobin, Farrell and McElroy, appointed Consultor of the Secretariat for Communications, well-known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda, chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families, is nothing but a sad recent example of that deviated wing of the Society of Jesus.
",-1
"Pope Francis has repeatedly asked for total transparency in the Church and for bishops and faithful to act with parrhesia.
",-1
"The faithful throughout the world also demand this of him in an exemplary manner.
",-1
"He must honestly state when he first learned about the crimes committed by McCarrick, who abused his authority with seminarians and priests.
",-1
"In any case, the Pope learned about it from me on June 23, 2013 and continued to cover for him.
",-1
"He did not take into account the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on him and made him his trusted counselor along with Maradiaga.
",-1
"The latter [Maradiaga] is so confident of the Pope’s protection that he can dismiss as “gossip” the heartfelt appeals of dozens of his seminarians, who found the courage to write to him after one of them tried to commit suicide over homosexual abuse in the seminary.
",-1
"In the case of the former Auxiliary Bishop Juan José Pineda, after the article published in the [Italian] weekly L’Espresso last February, Maradiaga stated in the newspaper Avvenire: “It was my auxiliary bishop Pineda who asked for the visitation, so as to ‘clear’ his name after being subjected to much slander.” Now, regarding Pineda the only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted, thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere.
",-1
"In the name of the transparency so hailed by the Pope, the report that the Visitator, Argentine bishop Alcides Casaretto, delivered more than a year ago only and directly to the Pope, must be made public.
",-1
"Finally, the recent appointment as Substitute of Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra is also connected with Honduras, that is, with Maradiaga.
",-1
"From 2003 to 2007 Peña Parra worked as Counsellor at the Tegucigalpa Nunciature.
",-1
"As Delegate for Pontifical Representations I received worrisome information about him.
",-1
"In Honduras, a scandal as huge as the one in Chile is about to be repeated.
",-1
"The Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops.
",-1
"First he insulted the abuse victims.
",-1
"Even in the tragic affair of McCarrick, Pope Francis’s behavior was no different.
",-1
"Although he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end; indeed, he made McCarrick’s advice his own, which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church.
",-1
"It was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action [regarding McCarrick] to save his image in the media.
",-1
"Now in the United States a chorus of voices is rising especially from the lay faithful, and has recently been joined by several bishops and priests, asking that all those who, by their silence, covered up McCarrick’s criminal behavior, or who used him to advance their career or promote their intentions, ambitions and power in the Church, should resign.
",-1
"A time of conversion and penance must be proclaimed.
",-1
"The virtue of chastity must be recovered in the clergy and in seminaries.
",-1
"Corruption in the misuse of the Church’s resources and of the offerings of the faithful must be fought against.
",-1
"The seriousness of homosexual behavior must be denounced.
",-1
"The homosexual networks present in the Church must be eradicated, as Janet Smith, Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, recently wrote.
",-1
"“The problem of clergy abuse,” she wrote, “cannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops, and even less so by bureaucratic directives.
",-1
"The deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated.” These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.
",-1
"I implore everyone, especially Bishops, to speak up in order to defeat this conspiracy of silence that is so widespread, and to report the cases of abuse they know about to the media and civil authorities.
",-1
"In his 2008 homily on the Feast of the Epiphany, Pope Benedict reminded us that the Father’s plan of salvation had been fully revealed and realized in the mystery of Christ’s death and resurrection, but it needs to be welcomed in human history, which is always a history of fidelity on God’s part and unfortunately also of infidelity on the part of us men.
",-1
"At the Angelus on Sunday, August 12, 2018 Pope Francis said these words: “Everyone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ...
",-1
"If we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it.
",-1
"We need to intervene where evil is spreading; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking.” If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer, how much graver is it for the Church’s supreme pastor, who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt.
",-1
"And how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church!
",-1
"Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren.
",-1
"Indeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ’s flock.
",-1
"In this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick’s abuses and resign along with all of them.
",-1
"Even in dismay and sadness over the enormity of what is happening, let us not lose hope!
",-1
"We well know that the great majority of our pastors live their priestly vocation with fidelity and dedication.
",-1
"It is in moments of great trial that the Lord’s grace is revealed in abundance and makes His limitless mercy available to all; but it is granted only to those who are truly repentant and sincerely propose to amend their lives.
",-1
"This is a favorable time for the Church to confess her sins, to convert, and to do penance.
",-1
"Let us all pray for the Church and for the Pope, let us remember how many times he has asked us to pray for him!
",-1
"Let us all renew faith in the Church our Mother: “I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church!”

"Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of “America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy”
",-1
"According to the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), Khecharem also said: “After the laws of Allah were abandoned, and the heretic regimes were imposed on the Muslims, the most important thing to do is to restore the rule of the Muslims, through the Quran and the Sunna, in order to renew Islamic life and to deliver the Islamic message to the world.
",-1
"My brothers, the implication of this today should be the establishment of an Islamic state over all the lands of the Muslims.”
",-1
"If Said Khecharem were a non-Muslim saying that Muslims needed to destroy “the filthy Jewish entity” and conquer America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy, he would be accused of “Islamophobia” and “bigotry.” But no one will take any particular notice of this.
",-1
"They should, however.
",-1
"Khecharem is not some deluded fanatic raving on a Tunisian street corner.
",-1
"He was speaking at Hizb ut-Tahrir’s International Caliphate Conference; although Hizb ut-Tahrir is banned in many countries, it still has an international presence, and recently held a conference in Chicago.
",-1
"Nor is the desire to establish a global caliphate limited to Hizb ut-Tahrir alone.
",-1
"The word khalifa means “successor”; the caliph in Sunni Islamic theology is the successor of Muhammad as the military, political, and spiritual leader of the Muslims.
",-1
"As I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS , the great caliphates of history, from the immediate post-Muhammad period of the “Rightly Guided Caliphs” to the Umayyads, Abbasids, and Ottomans, as well as other Islamic states, all waged relentless jihad warfare against non-Muslims, subjugating them under the rule of Islamic law and denying them basic rights.
",-1
"This was, for fourteen centuries, mainstream, normative Islam, carried forth by the primary authorities in the Islamic world at the time.
",-1
"The History of Jihad shows from the accounts of eyewitnesses and contemporary chroniclers through the ages that in every age and in every place where there were Muslims, some of them believed that they had a responsibility given to them by Allah to wage war against and subjugate unbelievers under the rule of Islamic law.
",-1
"And so it is today: Said Khecharem has enunciated that responsibility more clearly and directly than most Muslim spokesmen do these days, but he is by no means the only one who believes that it exists.
",-1
"What is noteworthy also about The History of Jihad is something that it does not contain.
",-1
"As the jihadis move against non-Muslim states without any letup, pause, period of coexistence, period of tolerance, reformation, or reconsideration, there never appears any force of Muslims to oppose them.
",-1
"While it is undoubtedly true that not all Muslims in any given age have ever waged jihad, there has never been in Islamic history an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad and dedicated to stopping those who were waging it.
",-1
"So it is today.
",-1
"Islamic groups in the West issue pro-forma condemnations after every jihad terror attack, but are doing little or nothing to try to prevent the next one.
",-1
"Meanwhile, Said Khecharem and other Islamic spokesmen openly call for Muslims to engage in jihad conquest.
",-1
"Western authorities should be pondering his words, and their implications, very carefully.
",-1
"They have yet to come to grips with the fact that “extremism” is and always has been so distressingly widespread in Muslim communities.
",-1
"But they will.
",-1
"In his eleven-page account, affirmed under oath, the Archbishop, marking a turning point in Church history, declares that senior Vatican officials, including former Secretaries of State Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone as well as Cardinal Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga, coordinator of Pope Bergoglio’s “Council of Cardinals”, covered up McCarrick’s decades of sexual predation and that Bergoglio himself continued the coverup.
",-1
"Regarding Bergoglio, Viganò testifies that in 2013 he personally informed him about McCarrick’s history, the dossier of the Congregation for Bishops on his sexual crimes against boys and young men, and the disciplinary sanctions imposed upon him by Benedict XVI (forbidding residence in a seminary, public appearances and Masses).
",-1
"Evidently already aware of these facts, however, Bergoglio not only rehabilitated McCarrick but made him a “trusted counselor” who advised the elevation of the pro-homosexual prelates Blase Cupich, Joseph Tobin and Kevin Farrell to the College of Cardinals and the prominent episcopal sees they now discredit.
",-1
"Viganò concludes his testimony by declaring that all of the prelates involved (many others are implicated), including Bergoglio, should resign their offices for the good of the Church.
",-1
"As to Bergoglio in particular, he courageously states openly the truth that so many of his brethren know but fear to speak in public:
",-1
"[my emphasis] Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren.
",-1
"[emphasis in original]
",-1
"Before he was papal nuncio in Washington, Viganò headed the Governorate of Vatican City State after having served as Nuncio in Nigeria, a Delegate for the Pontifical Representatives of the Secretary of State of the Holy See and a Member of the Disciplinary Commission of the Roman Curia.
",-1
"In those capacities he had access to documents and witnesses that corroborate his own firsthand testimony.
",-1
"The campaign to discredit Archbishop Viganò began instantaneously on the Catholic left wing.
",-1
"John Allen’s instant analysis attempting to impeach Viganò’s testimony is, as one would expect from him, a bit craftier.
",-1
"Evidence.
",-1
"Speaking to Catholic News Agency, Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, who served as first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington, confirmed that “Viganò said the truth.
",-1
"Furthermore, a series of prelates has vouched for Viganò’s character and credibility:
",-1
"- Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas has gone so far as to order all the priests in his diocese to read from the pulpit a statement that he finds Viganò’s allegations credible.
",-1
"- Bishop Athanasius Schneider declares: “Archbishop Viganò confirmed his statement by a sacred oath invoking the name of God.
",-1
"There is, therefore, no reasonable and plausible cause to doubt the truth content of the document of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò.”
",-1
"Bergoglio Pleads the Fifth
",-1
"Bergoglio himself, however, has already precluded any attempt to impeach Viganò’s testimony.
",-1
"During the return flight from Dublin after the “World Meeting of Familes,” he was asked to comment on Viganò ’s allegations that he had informed Bergoglio of McCarrick’s crimes in 2013 as well as the sanctions imposed by Benedict.
",-1
"Bergoglio declined to incriminate himself:
",-1
"Read the statement carefully yourselves and make your own judgment.
",-1
"I am not going to say a word about this.
",-1
"I believe that the statement speaks for itself, and you all have sufficient journalistic ability to draw conclusions.
",-1
"It is an act of trust.
",-1
"When a little time goes by, and you have drawn conclusions, perhaps I will speak about it, but I would like your professional maturity to do this work.
",-1
"It will do you all good, really.
",-1
"Seems to be.
",-1
"Obviously.
",-1
"While events have overtaken Faggioli’s piece, it will remain useful here as a prime example of the neo-Catholic polemic.
",-1
"But before I address Faggioli’s latest defense of the indefensible, some background is in order, including a discussion of further key details of Viganò’s testimony.
",-1
"This would explain why he will not a “say a word about” Viganò’s charges against him.
",-1
"The Archbishop reveals, as already noted, that Pope Benedict imposed sanctions on McCarrick under which he “was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.” Viganò further reveals that those sanctions were communicated to McCarrick by then Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi, but were also repeated by Viganò himself when he succeeded Sambi as Nuncio:
",-1
"I repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature.
",-1
"Viganò wanted to know why McCarrick had apparently been relieved of the sanctions.
",-1
"During the audience Bergoglio queried: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” and Viganò replied with the truth Bergoglio obviously did not want to hear:
",-1
"I answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naiveté: “Holy Father, I don’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him.
",-1
"It was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis’s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews….
",-1
"It was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action to save his image in the media.
",-1
"[all emphasis in original]
",-1
"It was McCarrick, noted Marco Tosatti, who was behind the elevation of Blase Cupich to the key position of Archbishop of Chicago, where Cupich has since promoted the homosexual subversion of Father James Martin.
",-1
"Their names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.” That is, the normal process was circumvented for these appointments.
",-1
"As I wrote back then, with the likes of Cupich in view:
",-1
"Cupich is the very model of a Novus Ordo bishop.
",-1
"We must no longer subsidize the malpractice of the architects of ruin.
",-1
"Nor must we join the neo-Catholics in their mindless applause when one of these incompetents attempts to repoint a brick or two in the crumbling façade they have erected to obscure the Church of old.
",-1
"And it was McCarrick who obtained the cardinal’s hat for his roommate of six years, Kevin Farrell, whom he consecrated a bishop.
",-1
"But Bergoglio has also lent his own authority to Martin’s effort to mainstream homosexuality in the Church.
",-1
"Any purge would empty parishes and religious orders of the thousands of priests and bishops who lead healthy lives of service and faithful lives of celibacy.”
",-1
"A Worldwide Network of Corruption, Beginning at the Top
",-1
"None of the foregoing is meant to suggest that the homosexual invasion of the Catholic hierarchy is confined to American prelates and priests.
",-1
"Moreover, it was Bergoglio’s right hand man, Cardinal Maradiaga, who sheltered his friend, Juan José Pineda, auxiliary Bishop of Tegucigalpa, from any discipline over his notorious homosexual liaisons with seminarians in that diocese.
",-1
"First, he insulted the abuse victims.
",-1
"Then, only when he was forced by the media, and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful, did he recognize his error and apologize, while stating that he had been misinformed, causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile, but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati.
",-1

"Defending the Council by Defending the Homosexual Status Quo
",-1
"I stand with Archbishop Carlo Vigano.
",-1
"Today, our ridiculous suggestion is the stuff of mainstream news.
",-1
"Wuerl, says Faggioli, “faces a complex situation: on the one hand Wuerl was not afraid of clashing with the tribunal over the Apostolic Signatura in the Vatican which wanted to readmit a priest from the Pittsburgh diocese to ministry… while in other cases he seems to have collaborated in covering up some cases… It is a very difficult position also because Wuerl became a symbol… beyond the specific accusations against him, from which he could not publicly defend himself.”
",-1
"….
",-1
"I myself brought up the subject [of McCarrick] with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn’t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it.
",-1
"What really concerns Faggioli and those who think like him is not Wuerl and his “complex situation,” which is not complex at all.
",-1
"But what exactly is a neo-traditionalist?
",-1
"As Faggioli puts it: “In the last fifteen years, the American Catholic Church has been traversed by a radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo-traditionalism sense, especially in the younger generations of priests and intellectuals.
",-1
"They interpret the current abuse crisis as fruit of the mistakes of the Council itself and not only of the post-Council…”
",-1
"But one must realize that this council, which exposed itself to human judgment, insisted very much more upon this pleasant side of man, rather than on his unpleasant one.
",-1
"Its attitude was very much and deliberately optimistic.
",-1
"Instead of depressing diagnoses, encouraging remedies; instead of direful prognostics, messages of trust issued from the council to the present-day world.
",-1
"Faggioli would probably be more inclined to civil or criminal prosecution of “Catholic Jacobins” for “hate speech” than Novus Ordo bishops for their complicity in covering up homosexual rapes.
",-1
"Faggioli’s argument demonstrates that neo-Catholicism has never been about making the authentic Faith more appealing to a “modern world” founded precisely on a rejection of the Church’s authority.
",-1
"It is not about the Faith at all.
",-1
"Rather, it is an ideological movement dedicated to the face-saving defense of a catastrophic failure in ecclesial innovation that has corrupted the human element of the Church in practically every department.
",-1
"That is exactly what a growing number of Catholics are now doing, as even the secular press recognized less than three months before Bergoglio began his tyrannical reign.
",-1
"A return to integral Tradition is the threat that Faggioli sees as coming particularly from the young.
",-1
"For some, it seems, no price is too great—not even the good of the Church—to avoid the personal ignominy of being seen on the wrong side of history.
",-1
"Conclusion: The Fatima Connection
",-1
"Long before the arrival of Bergoglio in Rome, the successive Vatican Secretaries of State, Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone, were instrumental in advancing the homosexual corruption of the Novus Ordo establishment.
",-1
"As to Bertone and Sodano, Viganò provides further vital testimony:
",-1
"Nuncio Sambi’s report [on McCarrick’s sexual abuse], with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State.
",-1
"Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information [concerning McCarrick] was communicated to him.
",-1
"Concerning my book, Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Viganò’s predecessor as Nuncio in Washington, whom Viganò’ credits with diligently reporting McCarrick’s crimes to the Vatican and conveying Benedict’s sanctions to McCarrick, made some very revealing comments during an interview with Robert Moynihan, published posthumously six years ago in Inside the Vatican:
",-1
"We were discussing the Third Secret of Fatima, the allegations that the Vatican has not published the entire text of the Third Secret as revealed to Sister Lucia, and the response of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, in a book where Bertone states that there is nothing more to be revealed.
",-1
"Sambi said, “Excuse me.” He got up, went out of the room, and came back with a book.
",-1
"“Here,” he said.
",-1
"“Do you know this book?
",-1
"You should read it.” It was Christopher Ferrara's The Secret Still Hidden.
",-1
"“Wait,” I said.
",-1
"And in the end, we are all after the truth, aren’t we?
",-1
"The truth is the important thing...”
",-1
"The truth is indeed the important thing.
",-1
"And the truth about our situation is revealed in that still-hidden part of the Secret to whose contents Pope Benedict alluded during his pilgrimage to Fatima in 2010, identifying elements that do not appear at all in the obscure vision published back in 2000, which Sodano and Bertone tried to pass of as the entirety of the Secret at the same time they were covering up homosexual corruption in high places:

"The government needs to stop cooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA immediately.

"4.
",-1
"Most importantly, as Sebastian Gorka urges in Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, the government needs to lay down a vision, an actual “threat doctrine analysis” in a thorough document, just like George Kennan’s Long Telegram and NSC-68 did in laying out the strategic foundation to fighting communism in the Cold War.
",-1
"It is absolutely mind-boggling that nothing of this sort exists today in our terror war — and it is a reflection of the Left being in charge and of the destructive defeat that it is sowing.

"Launch Our Own Counter-propaganda Campaign.
",-1
"The Left and Islamists engage in propaganda 24/7.
",-1
"What does our propaganda war entail?
",-1
"Consequently, educational programs have to be set up everywhere, from public schools to universities to workplaces, in businesses and numerous other institutions.
",-1
"This has to also involve, as Gorka urges, “a nationwide program of education that includes the armed services as well as federal, state, and local police forces and the intelligence community.”
",-1
"6.
",-1
"Affirm Sharia’s Assault on the U.S. Constitution as Seditious.
",-1
"remember how CAIR advised Muslims not to talk to the FBI).
",-1
"Indeed, once the government discerns and labels the elements of Islamic law that threaten the American Constitution, any preaching and spreading of those elements in America must be labelled as seditious.
",-1
"7.
",-1
"Put Pressure on Mosques, Islamic Groups and Schools.

"Of course, anyone who paid attention was aware of Google’s attempts to interfere on Clinton’s behalf.

"WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange revealed two years ago that Google CEO Eric Schmidt and a number of Google employees created a company in 2015 specifically to place Clinton the White House.

"Emails obtained by WikiLeaks showed correspondence between Schmidt and Clinton, along with a number of Clinton operatives discussing strategy meetings and campaign ideas.

"Among the strategies was the creation of a voter tracking database using smart phones.

"This, of course, isn’t the first evidence of Google doing all they could to help Hillary win the election.
",-1
"In an April 15, 2014 email from Google’s then-Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt found in the WikiLeaked Podesta emails, titled “Notes for a 2016 Democratic Campaign,” Schmidt tells Cheryl Mills that “I have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and I have scheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better.
",-1
"This is simply a draft but do let me know if this is a helpful process for you all.”

",-1
"As a reminder, in late October of 2016 it was revealed that just days prior to the April 15, 2014 email, Schmidt had sent another email in which he expressed his eagerness to “fund” the campaign efforts and wants to be a “head outside advisor.” In the email from John Podesta to Robby Mook we learned that:
",-1
"I met with Eric Schmidt tonight.
",-1
"As David reported, he’s ready to fund, advise recruit talent, etc.
",-1
"He was more deferential on structure than I expected.

"Wasn’t pushing to run through one of his existing firms.

"Clearly wants to be head outside advisor, but didn’t seem like he wanted to push others out.

"This time?
",-1
"This time, an email chain has emerged showing senior company executives pressing for the company to sway Latino voters to back Hillary Clinton.
",-1
"First censorship, now this.
",-1
"From Breitbart:
",-1
"An email chain among senior Google executives from the day after the 2016 presidential election reveals the company tried to influence the 2016 United States presidential election on behalf of one candidate, Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.
",-1
"The main email, headlined, “Election results and the Latino vote,” was sent on Nov. 9, 2016—the day after Clinton’s loss to Trump in the 2016 presidential election—by Eliana Murillo, Google’s Multicultural Marketing department head.
",-1
"Murillo wrote at the outset of the lengthy message:
",-1
"We worked very hard.
",-1
"Many people did.
",-1
"We pushed tp get out the Latino vote with our features, our partners, and our voices.
",-1
"We emphasized our mission to give Latinos access to information so that they can make an informed decision at the polls, and we feel very grateful for all the support to do this important work.
",-1
"A large percentage of Latino voters in Florida were new voters who had become citizens just in time to vote.
",-1
"We saw high traffic for the search queries ‘votar,’ ‘como votar,’ and ‘donde voter,’ in key states like Florida and Nevada.
",-1
"We will be pulling in more info in the coming hours/days but so far we definitely know there was high traffic on search in Spanish.
",-1
"Without translating our tools the users wouldn’t have found the information they needed.
",-1
"Objectively speaking, our goal was met — we pushed and successfully launched the search features in Spanish, and we thank Lisa for her support in advocating for this work.
",-1
"I sent Philipp a note yesterday to thank him because he and others voiced their support for this too, and we greatly appreciate it.
",-1
"Even Sundar gave the effort a shout out and a comment in Spanish, which was really special.
",-1
"“Sundar” presumably refers to Google’s chief executive officer Sundar Pichai, who took the reins of the massive search giant in October 2015.
",-1
"“Lisa” presumably refers to Lisa Gevelber, the vice president of Global Marketing for Google—who forwarded Murillo’s entire four-page email to several other Google executives in another chain also obtained by Breitbart News in which Gevelber praises Murillo’s activities with official company resources as having made a “great difference.” “Philipp” presumably refers to Philipp Schindler, a senior vice president and Google’s chief business officer per his LinkedIn page.
",-1
"The emails were first revealed on Fox News on Monday evening on Tucker Carlson Tonight by anchor Tucker Carlson in a special report.
",-1
"Breitbart News also obtained them, and has reached out to Google with a number of questions about the emails.
",-1
"Carlson, in his exclusive report on Fox News Monday night, compared the revelations in the Google emails to the probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election to Special Counsel Robert Mueller—raising the question about how much influence tech giants like Google and Facebook have on election outcomes in the United States.
",-1
"Epstein has published research detailing how Google could influence the results of U.S. elections.
",-1
"In his report on Monday night, Carlson then described the emails he obtained, which Breitbart News also obtained.
",-1
"Carlson said:
",-1
"It wasn’t aimed at all potential voters.
",-1
"It wasn’t even aimed at a balanced cross-section of subgroups.
",-1
"Google didn’t try to get out the vote among say Christian Arabs in Michigan or say Persian Jews in Los Angeles—they sometimes vote Republican.
",-1
"Furthermore, this mobilization effort targeted not only the entire country but swing states vital to the Hillary campaign.
",-1
"This was not an exercise in civics, this was political consulting.
",-1
"It was in effect an in-kind contribution to the Hillary Clinton campaign.”
",-1
"Carlson noted that in communication with Google, the company “did not deny that the email was real or that it showed a clear political preference.”
",-1
"The email from Murillo continues by explaining just how expansive the efforts the company undertook to achieve its objective were:
",-1
"We had our partners help spread the word about our features on social media, including YouTubers and influencers like Dulce Candy, Jorge Narvaez, Jessie y Joy, Barbara Bermudo, and Pamela Silva of Univision, Jackie Cruz aka La Flaca from Orange is the New Black, and more.
",-1
"We promoted our partner the Latino Community Foundation’s non-partisan #YoVoyaVotaryTu (I’m going to vote, are you?)
",-1
"This reached 4.4M social media impressions and signaled to many that Google and our partners value the Latino community and our role in this election.
",-1
"If Murillo had ended her email there, this probably would not amount to the level of a national news story.
",-1
"Murillo wrote in the next paragraph:
",-1
"We even helped them create ad campaigns to promote the rides (with support from HOLA folks who rallied and volunteered their time to help).
",-1
"We supported Voto Latino to help them land an interview with Senator Meza of Arizona (key state for us) to talk about the election and how to use Google search to find information about how to vote.
",-1
"They were a strong partner, among many in this effort.
",-1
"The next paragraph is where Murillo begins to make her next major admission: that the effort was not just to increase voter turnout generally but to elect Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.
",-1
"“Ultimately, after all was said and done, the Latino community did come out to vote, and completely surprised us,” Murillo wrote.
",-1
"“We never anticipated that 29% of Latinos would vote for Trump.
",-1
"On the next page, the email continues with a headline from an article in The Atlantic by James Fallows: “2016: The Year Latinos Saved America?”
",-1
"Trump did not end up winning Nevada in the end, but he did beat Clinton in 30 and a half other states.
",-1
"“We read the headline and thought WOW, we did it!”
",-1
"Then she begins writing again: “But then reality set in.
",-1
"Only 71% of Latinos voted for Hillary, and that wasn’t enough.”
",-1
"From there, Murillo continues writing for another page and a half:
",-1
"The voters we wanted to reach did end up having an influence in the end, most notably in Florida.
",-1
"Latino voters voted for Trump more in Florida than in other states (31%), and FL was critical by popular vote and the electoral college.
",-1
"We’ll keep an eye on any other results that can show us the influence that our efforts had on the election.
",-1
"We know we gave this our best and are now figuring out what comes next.
",-1
"Thanks again for all your help and support in this effort.
",-1
"“I have tried to stay objective, but I ask that you please give us some time to pause and reflect,” Murillo wrote.
",-1
"After all these efforts and what we thought was positive momentum toward change, the results are not what we expected at all.
",-1
"We are afraid for our families, and especially for the millions of immigrants who now don’t know what the future holds for them.”
",-1
"Murillo wrote:
",-1
"What’s most difficult for us is we can’t even email the HOLA list to reach our community and discuss what this means for us because we know that apparently some may actually be Trump supporters.
",-1
"One in a remote office said ‘If you guys do any sort of meetings, I’d love to join virtually.
",-1
"I think I’m currently the only Latinx in my office.
",-1
"It’s kinda hard.’ #understatement.
",-1
"She was not done there.
",-1
"She also says that the company—and herself in particular—will redouble efforts in the future to get a different and more desired result in future elections.
",-1
"“Loss is a part of life, and I do think frustrations challenge us to work smarter and get creative.
",-1
"My partners have sent notes and are saying the same thing — time to keep working harder.”
",-1
"“If you see a Latino Googler in the office (California/New York), please give them a smile,” Murillo wrote.
",-1
"It’s tough to handle now that we know not all of us were against this, so we may be even more divided than ever.
",-1
"At least in CA/NY though, you can rest assured that the Latinos of these blue states need your thoughts and prayers, at least for them and their families.”
",-1
"Then, she continues by stating she is going on a planned vacation she thought she was taking to “celebrate” a Clinton win, but after Trump won, she says, her vacation “will be time to reflect on how to continue to support my community through these difficult times.”
",-1
"Murillo, in the next line, reveals that she thought she was sharing her viewpoints on these matters in a tight circle that would not leak.
",-1
"“I’m not sharing my personal opinions very broadly, but wanted to share openly here in the circle of trust,” she wrote.
",-1
"Her original email was forwarded on to other Google executives by the aforementioned Gevelber, according to another email obtained by Breitbart News.
",-1
"“It’s from Eliana Murillo who runs US Hispanic Marketing on my team and who helped found HOLA our Hispanic ERC.”
",-1
"A source close to the White House who has reviewed these emails ahead of their public release told Breitbart News that in a just world this would amount to, at a minimum, a clear violation of campaign finance law governing in-kind contributions to campaigns and causes.

",-1
"A source familiar with the confirmation proceedings told Fox News that Feinstein received the letter back in July, but did not make its existence known publicly until Thursday.
",-1
"According to a report by The Intercept, the letter was relayed to lawmakers by an individual affiliated with Stanford University and concerns an incident involving the 53-year-old Kavanaugh and a woman while they were in high school.

"Brett Kavanaugh accused in letter obtained by FBI of drunkenly forcing himself on woman while in high school; Kavanaugh denies it happened
",-1
"According to the New York Daily News, Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, held a woman down, covered her mouth and tried to force himself on her while drunk at a party in high school.
",-1
"That’s the nexus of a letter allegedly acquired by Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein in July but dropped on the last days before the vote for Kavanaugh’s confirmation.
",-1
"The unidentified woman says the incident took place at a party in the early 1980s while Kavanaugh was a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda, Md., according to the NYDN, which claims to have obtained the letter on Friday.
",-1
"She alleges Kavanaugh and a friend of his, both of whom had been drinking, cornered her in a room and turned up the music to blur out the sound of her protests.
",-1
"Kavanaugh then allegedly covered the woman’s mouth with his hand and attempted to force himself on her, but she says she managed to free herself and bolt out of the room.
",-1
"“I did not do this back in high school or at any time.”
",-1
"Kavanaugh’s friend, who has not been identified, did not outright deny the woman’s claims but told the New Yorker he has “no recollection of that.”
",-1
"The woman says she has had to undergo psychological treatment as a result of the incident.
",-1
"She first approached her congresswoman, Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., about the allegations in July shortly after Trump tapped Kavanaugh to replace outgoing Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.
",-1
"Eshoo’s office declined to comment.
",-1
"The woman’s letter was in turn forwarded to Feinstein, D-Calif., who shared it with the FBI and her Democratic committee colleagues on Wednesday night.
",-1
"An FBI official told the New York Daily News on Thursday that the letter has not yet resulted in a criminal investigation.
",-1
"According to Breitbart, on Friday, 65 women from both the Republican and Democrat parties who have known Kavanaugh since high school defended his character and said he has always behaved “honorably” and treaded “women with respect.”
",-1
"The women also said that Kavanaugh has “stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity.”
",-1
"“Judge Kavanaugh has denied this allegation and over 60 women – with a broad range of political views – who’ve known him since high school, have sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee vouching for his integrity and respect for women over that time,” says Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network.
",-1
"They have resorted to peddling an allegation of sexual misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh that supposedly occurred while the judge was in high school.
",-1
"The accuser had refused to identify herself before and during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings.
",-1
"She conveniently waited until this Sunday to come forward via an on-the-record interview with the Washington Post.
",-1
"The accuser’s name is Christine Blasey Ford, a registered Democrat who is currently a California professor teaching clinical psychology.
",-1
"I did not do this back in high school or at any time.""
",-1
"Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee that heard Judge Kavanaugh’s public testimony earlier this month during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, had received last July a copy of a letter written by the woman making the charge, who we now know was Ms. Ford.
",-1
"Even though Senator Feinstein had the letter in hand, she never brought up the charge during the public hearing, nor during her own meeting with the judge.
",-1
"Instead, Senator Feinstein sat on the letter until late last week, when she issued a cryptic release stating that she had received the letter but did not want to give more details in deference to the woman’s wish to keep the matter confidential.
",-1
"Senator Feinstein turned the letter over to the FBI.
",-1
"The FBI placed the letter in its background file on Judge Kavanaugh but decided not to pursue any further investigation.
",-1
"Senator Feinstein had initially resisted sharing the contents of the letter with her fellow Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee or to go public with its existence because “the incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion” and she had already “taken care of it,” according to a source quoted by The New Yorker.
",-1
"The New Yorker article, written before Ms. Ford publicly identified herself, provided some details regarding her allegation.
",-1
"However, now Ms. Ford has decided to do what she called her “civic responsibility” and tell her own story publicly.
",-1
"While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it.
",-1
"When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.
",-1
"‘I thought he might inadvertently kill me,’ said Ford.
",-1
"‘He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.’” Ms. Ford said she was able to escape the room and go home without any apparent further incident after “Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.”
",-1
"Here is where Ms. Ford’s story becomes quite murky and begins to fall apart.
",-1
"Although Ms. Ford believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, she “said she does not remember some key details of the incident,” according to the Washington Post article.
",-1
"For example, Ms. Ford “said she does not remember how the gathering came together the night of the incident.” She also does not remember how she got home.
",-1
"Yet she claims to be absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, whom she presumably knew only as an acquaintance and said she had not spoken to since the night the incident allegedly occurred, was involved in the alleged incident.
",-1
"Ms. Ford admitted that she “told no one at the time what had happened to her.” In fact, she said she recalled thinking: “I’m not ever telling anyone this.
",-1
"This is nothing, it didn’t happen, and he didn’t rape me.” Even if one explains this behavior as the natural reaction of a frightened teenager to a highly traumatic incident, that does not explain why, by her own admission, she “told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband,” according to the Washington Post article.
",-1
"In other words, the only written documentation Ms. Ford has offered in support of her allegation about the incident she said took place while she was in high school – a therapist’s notes of a couples therapy session occurring 30 years after the alleged incident – did not mention Judge Kavanaugh’s name.
",-1
"Judge Kavanaugh has had extensive background checks performed on him in the past for his various federal government positions, including for his current position as a federal appellate court judge, without the accusation ever having surfaced.
",-1
"In a letter addressed to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senator Feinstein, 65 women who said they knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school vouched for his character:
",-1
"We are women who have known Brett Kavanaugh for more than 35 years and knew him while he attended high school between 1979 and 1983.
",-1
"He was an outstanding student and athlete with a wide circle of friends.
",-1
"Almost all of us attended all-girls high schools in the area.
",-1
"We knew Brett well through social events, sports, church, and various other activities.
",-1
"Many of us have remained close friends with him and his family over the years.
",-1
"Through the more than 35 years we have known him, Brett has stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity.
",-1

"The signers of this letter hold a broad range of political views.
",-1
"Many of us are not lawyers, but we know Brett Kavanaugh as a person.
",-1
"And he has always been a good person.
",-1
"They have done so in the face of Judge Kavanaugh’s lifetime record of stellar public service, multiple background checks producing no evidence of sexual misconduct, and the letter written by the 65 women, who knew him when he was in high school and thereafter and who signed their names to a ringing endorsement of his good character.

"The Democrats have called upon the Senate to postpone the vote on Kavanaugh.

"Establishment Republicans are racing for the exits.
",-1
"But over what?
",-1
"An unprovable accusation from decades ago that the accuser said nothing about until years later, and that is uncorroborated by any other testimony or by the evidence of any similar behavior on Kavanaugh’s part.
",-1
"“Weighing the Allegations against Brett Kavanaugh,” by David French, National Review, September 16, 2018:
",-1
"They’re serious but not solid.
",-1
"The allegations against Brett Kavanaugh — outlined now on the record in the Washington Post by Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford — are substantial and serious.
",-1
"She claims that Kavanaugh knocked her down, groped her, and attempted to remove her clothes.
",-1
"Here’s the core of her story:
",-1
"“I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California.
",-1
"“He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.
",-1
"She said she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house.
",-1
"Do not count me among those who would minimize this alleged assault.
",-1
"I went to a high school that had more than its share of drunken parties, and my classmates could do crazy and stupid things, but an act like this was beyond the pale.
",-1
"Circuit Court of Appeals.
",-1
"Since Kavanaugh has denied the story, however, the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot.
",-1
"At the very least, if the attack happened, he should be disqualified for lying.
",-1
"Yet unless all parties start telling the same story, there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred.
",-1
"We don’t need certainty, however, to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the Supreme Court.
",-1
"I have the same standard for Brett Kavanaugh as I did for Roy Moore, for Donald Trump, for Bill Clinton — or for any other politician who’s accused of misconduct.
",-1
"Is it more likely than not that the allegation is true?
",-1
"Given the totality of the evidence, I believe it is more likely than not that Bill Clinton committed rape and sexual harassment.
",-1
"I believe it is more likely than not that Donald Trump has committed sexual assault.
",-1
"I believe it is more likely than not that Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls.
",-1
"But the evidence against Kavanaugh falls far short of the evidence arrayed against each of these men.
",-1
"Here’s why:
",-1
"First, one way to help test the veracity of old claims is to ask whether there is any contemporaneous corroboration.
",-1
"Did the accuser tell a friend or family member or anyone about the alleged assault when it occurred?
",-1
"With Clinton, Trump, Moore, and many other politicians and celebrities, there was ample contemporaneous corroboration.
",-1
"Here, there was not.
",-1
"According to the Washington Post, “Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband.”
",-1
"That’s almost three decades of silence — three decades when memories can grow cloudy and recollections can change.
",-1
"But even the allegedly corroborating notes of the therapist raise a separate problem.
",-1
"They actually contradict her story on a key detail.
",-1
"According to the Post, “The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy that Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part.
",-1
"Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.” Nor do the notes mention Kavanaugh’s name, even though her husband says Ford named Kavanaugh in the sessions.
",-1
"At least the investigation seems somewhat manageable.
",-1
"If there were only four boys there, who were the other two?
",-1
"Let’s hear from them.
",-1
"In fact, investigators should interview everyone else at the party.
",-1
"Yet given all the years that have passed, would it be possible to find anyone who remembers being at that party?
",-1
"Would they remember any details at all?
",-1
"If another attendee says, “He was totally sober and with me the whole time,” that helps Kavanaugh.
",-1
"But the odds of getting details that precise are long indeed, and there is always a chance that a motivated classmate might lie — for either person….

"Trump Orders Declassification Of ‘Russian Probe’ Documents, Including Texts
",-1
"The documents to be declassified include all FBI reports on interviews with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all other applications to surveil Carter Page.
",-1
"Trump also asked that other important documents be declassified as well, including 21 pages worth of an application for a renewed surveillance warrant against former campaign aide Carter Page, according to Fox News.
",-1
"The 21 pages Trump wants to be declassified only make up a small part of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in heavily redacted format.
",-1
"According to the redacted version as reported by Fox News, three of the declassified pages contain information included in a section titled “The Russian Government’s Coordinated Efforts to Influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.” That section includes reference to the potential coordination between people associated with Trump’s campaign and the alleged Russian election interference effort.
",-1
"White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said President Trump had ordered the documents released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department “[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency.”
",-1
"The text messages are to be released “without redaction,” and those include messages from Ohr, Strzok, Lisa Page, former FBI Director James Comey, and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.
",-1
"Fox News further reported that a source familiar with the timing of the declassification told the media outlet that they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first, followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr.
",-1
"A Justice Department spokesperson told Fox News that the DOJ and FBI “are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President’s order.”

"I am not saying he is an abuser.

"But he sounds like one.”
",-1
"But why is Fisher still “working hard not to assume the worst” when there is no longer anything to assume as the ever-mounting evidence of malintent has been in plain view for years?
",-1
"But it may already be too late to save a regime whose only defense is not truth but raw power.
",-1
"At last count, some 29 bishops have publicly declared Viganò’s allegations against Bergoglio credible and worthy of investigation.
",-1
"Now even the distinguished canonist Edward Peters, who is no less than a Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, declares that if Viganò’s allegations are true then Bergoglio must go:
",-1
"Of what was said above concerning resignation from Church office in general, what would not apply to a pope, of all office holders, if he, as alleged by Viganò, from the first months of his papacy knowingly protected and favored a cardinal who was [pick a disgusting verb]-ing seminarians?
",-1
"Does the historical fact that some pretty bad popes held on to office despite committing various offenses justify other popes acting badly in shirking even the minimal gesture of resigning?
",-1
"Believing, as he does, that his claims are correct, Viganò, in calling for Francis’ resignation, has done nothing more or less than exercise his right under canon law “to manifest to the sacred pastors [his] opinion on matters which pertain to the good of the Church and to make [his] opinion known to the rest of the Christian faithful…” 1983 CIC 212 § 3.
",-1
"I have not called for Francis’ resignation because I do not know (with the degree of certitude that a lawyer seeks) whether Viganò’s key allegations against Francis are substantially true; most assuredly, however, if I reach the conclusion that they are true, I would say, without hesitation, that Francis should resign.
",-1
"Bergoglio will not, of course, resign.
",-1
"He will cling to power with his last breath in order to carry out the many other acts of ecclesial subversion he clearly has in mind.
",-1
"Yes, deposition.
",-1
"The Synod declared that Benedict IX (who had refused to appear) was deposed notwithstanding his attempt to undo his resignation.
",-1
"At Henry III’s designation, the German Bishop of Bamberg became Clement II, but he died after only a year, whereupon Benedict reasserted his claim to the papacy for the third time in 1047, only to be driven from Rome again by Imperial troops in 1048.
",-1
"Damasus II, another German bishop designated by Henry, reigned for a mere three weeks before dying, whereupon Pope St. Leo IX succeeded to the papacy, reigning until 1054.
",-1
"Leo, as John Rao observes, was the first in a line of Popes who “took charge of the movement of innovative Christian restoration” which included a breaking of the dominance of Roman nobility over papal elections.
",-1
"(Rao, Black Legends, 147-148).
",-1
"The King of Germany then appointed Clement II as Pope, who promptly crowned the King, Holy Roman Emperor.
",-1
"Benedict IX, after the death of Clement, claimed the papacy again!
",-1
"The Church to this day recognizes Clement II as a true Pope.”
",-1
"Moreover, Benedict IX himself is recognized as a true Pope—a valid but deposed Pope—during three separate periods listed as three distinct pontificates in the canon of Popes.
",-1
"This was possible owing to the lack of any set canonical form for papal elections; a Pope could gain or regain the office by various machinations.
",-1
"Indeed, even the Vatican’s own website states that Benedict was Pope from 1047-1048, the very year of his third ascension to the office from which he was finally driven by force.
",-1
"Only with the ascension of Pope Nicholas II in 1059 was it established that henceforth the cardinal-bishops would elect the Pope, with the other cardinals having the right to confirm or veto the nominee.
",-1
"By 1100 what we now know as the College of Cardinals, embracing all the cardinals of different titles, had the exclusive right to elect a Pope, and the members of the College “have held it ever since.” (Eric John, The Popes, 181).
",-1
"As Pope Benedict has observed, when it comes to the election of a Pope “the Spirit’s role should be understood in a much more elastic sense, not that he [sic] dictates the candidate for whom one must vote….
",-1
"So what can be done to defend the Church against Bergoglio?
",-1
"That the mode of papal election by cardinals has persisted for nearly a thousand years has led to the general impression that it pertains to the irreformable divine constitution of the Church, but it certainly does not.
",-1
"As to matters of purely ecclesiastical law such as this one the Church has always allowed for departures from traditional practice in cases of emergency or grave necessity.
",-1
"What would be the grounds for a declaration of deposition at such a gathering of prelates?
",-1
"One could readily point to the evidence that a faction that included Bergoglio himself had agreed upon his election before the conclave, and that all those involved, including Bergoglio, were thereby excommunicated latae sententiae in accordance with Article 81 of John Paul II’s Universi Dominici Gregis, which provides:
",-1
"The Cardinal electors shall further abstain from any form of pact, agreement, promise or other commitment of any kind which could oblige them to give or deny their vote to a person or persons.
",-1
"If this were in fact done, even under oath, I decree that such a commitment shall be null and void and that no one shall be bound to observe it; and I hereby impose the penalty of excommunication latae sententiae upon those who violate this prohibition.
",-1
"To quote Cajetan on this point (citations taken from the linked article by Robert Siscoe), deposition by an imperfect council is appropriate “when one or more Popes suffer uncertainty with regard to their election, as seems to have arisen in the schism of Urban VI and others.
",-1
"Then, lest the Church be perplexed, those members of the Church who are available have the power to judge which is the true pope, if it can be known, and if it cannot be known, [it has] the power to provide that the electors agree on one or another of them.”
",-1
"I am not saying that such a case has been proven.
",-1
"Rather, what I am saying is that this hypothetical imperfect council could determine that it has been proven and act accordingly, and that the Church would judge any resulting deposition of Bergoglio in the same manner it judges the deposition of Benedict IX.
",-1
"To quote Cajetan again: “Indeed the Church has the right to separate herself from an heretical pope according to divine law.
",-1
"Consequently, it has the right, by the same divine law, to use all means of themselves necessary for such separation; and those that juridically correspond to the crime, are of themselves necessary”—meaning the resort to an imperfect council.
",-1
"If a synod was able to declare the deposition of a pope in 1046, why not an imperfect council today—or, for that matter, another synod?
",-1
"It will be argued that such a deposition would provoke massive schisms in the Church.
",-1
"But that would not be the first time that defense of the Church’s common good has done so, as the Great Western Schism demonstrates.
",-1
"In any case, this much is certain: barring Bergoglio’s conversion and reversal of course, the Church cannot abide this pontificate any longer.
",-1
"One way or another, the Church will have to repel an attacker at her very summit.
",-1
"No, Bergoglio must go.
",-1
"May God give them the grace to do what must be done and what history will vindicate as a rescue of the Church during the height of the worst crisis in her history.

"Trump ordered the “immediate declassification” of “pages 10-12 and 17-34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in the matter of Carter W. Page,” “all FBI reports of interviews with Bruce G. Ohr prepared in connection with the Russia investigation,” and “all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all Carter Page FISA applications.”

",-1
"And so far it appears they’re succeeding.
",-1
"If Kavanaugh isn’t in place a week from Monday, the Supreme Court will begin hearing cases in its new term shorthanded.
",-1
"The high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have only been eight justices in place.
",-1
"Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.
",-1
"Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they hope to take control from Republicans.
",-1
"Election Day is November 6.
",-1
"The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.
",-1
"Christine Blasey Ford’s lawyers are trying to game the system.
",-1
"They know that Senate Judiciary Committee rules require Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to provide a full week’s notice for a hearing.
",-1
"So, if, for example, the committee followed the rules and agreed Friday (today) to a hearing, the soonest it could be held would be next Friday, the final business day before the Supreme Court’s new term begins.
",-1
"New demands and fake emergencies are bound to arise from Ford’s legal team.
",-1
"It was unclear at press time if the public hearing scheduled for Monday into the allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh would go forward.
",-1
"Kavanaugh informed the committee he was willing to testify Monday.
",-1
"“I continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name,"" he wrote in a letter.
",-1
"Ford's lawyer Debra Katz told the Judiciary Committee her client ""wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety.""
",-1
"Another Ford attorney reportedly said Wednesday that there are “multiple witnesses” who need to testify.
",-1
"""A hearing on Monday is not possible and the Committee's insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event,” Katz wrote in a letter.
",-1
"“Dr.
",-1
"Ford has asked me to let you know that she appreciates the various options you have suggested.
",-1
"Her strong preference continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony.”
",-1
"GOP lawmakers are figuring out how to respond to Ford’s request, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports:
",-1
"Late Thursday, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the Judiciary Committee chairman, said that his staff had discussed the issue with Ford’s attorney earlier in the day and that he would consult with his fellow committee members about the next move.
",-1
"Ford’s offer also increased the pressure on several key moderates — particularly GOP Sens.
",-1
"Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — whose votes will probably be needed to put Kavanaugh on the high court.
",-1
"The sexual assault allegation, which the nominee has denied, has upended his seemingly sure-bet confirmation and only increased the stakes for the key lawmakers.
",-1
"Chairman Grassley had imposed a Thursday deadline for Ford to submit testimony after her team said Tuesday she wasn’t willing to testify until the FBI investigates her sexual abuse allegations against Kavanaugh.
",-1
"Ford “really doesn’t want to testify,” he said.
",-1
"Besides, diGenova explained, the eleventh-hour sexual abuse claim leveled against Kavanaugh is a non-federal matter and in this case the alleged assault hasn’t even been clearly outlined by the alleged victim.
",-1
"Ford didn’t report it to anyone for decades and isn’t even certain when or where it happened, so the FBI can’t investigate the matter “because there is nothing to investigate.”
",-1
"Kavanaugh has already undergone six FBI background checks and the agency has ruled out investigating Ford’s allegation of drunken groping at a teenagers’ party 36 years ago.
",-1
"At the White House on Wednesday, President Trump said it would be ""wonderful"" if Ford testifies and ""unfortunate"" if she does not.

"Their commentary on the video below is interesting.
",-1
"Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) is to be commended on his handling of the situation.
",-1
"In the spirit of compromise, he called off the Senate committee vote that had been on the calendar for Thursday and scheduled a hearing for next Monday so that both Christine Ford and Brett Kavanaugh could state their cases.
",-1
"Kavanaugh immediately responded to Grassley.
",-1
"For 36 hours, there was silence from the Ford camp.
",-1
"Then, their demands began.
",-1
"First, it was reported that Ford would answer questions, but only at a closed hearing and only after an FBI investigation had been completed.
",-1
"Republicans felt that the request for a closed hearing was reasonable, but the demand for a new FBI investigation was not.
",-1
"The FBI investigates federal crimes and/or national security issues.
",-1
"When the FBI received Dianne Feinstein’s letter last week, they forwarded it to the White House to place in Kavanaugh’s background check file.
",-1
"(Note: The FBI has already conducted six background checks on Kavanaugh, the most recent one was done this summer.)
",-1
"It was announced later that Sen. Grassley would not change the date of the hearing set for Monday.
",-1
"Even Senators Jeff Flake, Bob Corker and Lindsey Graham, who have all said Ford needs to be heard, have indicated that if she does not show up for Monday's hearing, they will schedule a vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation.
",-1
"And she will only be questioned by members of the Senate panel, not outside lawyers.
",-1
"Why not Monday?
",-1
"Does she have an important dentist appointment she can't get out of?
",-1
"In order to avoid the criticism that will no doubt come anyway, the Republicans on the Senate Judicial committee have tried very hard to oblige Ford's requests, even offering to go to California to hear her testimony.
",-1
"She and her attorneys feel that they are in the driver's seat and thus, can call all the shots.
",-1
"The accuser doesn’t get to determine when and who investigates.
",-1
"In addition to the political reasons for the delay requests, it appears as if this woman is reluctant to testify under oath, possibly because she doesn’t want to perjure herself.
",-1
"Maybe she realizes the magnitude of what her accusations have unleashed.
",-1
"Either this did not happen at all or a much milder version of the situation she alleges occurred.
",-1
"Kavanaugh may have made a pass at her as 17-year-old boys (and even some 17-year-old girls) are known to do.
",-1
"Ford said no and that was it.
",-1
"Even she admits, they did not have sex, nor was this a hostage situation.
",-1
"The perception of events by a 15-year-old girl may differ significantly from reality.
",-1
"And 36 years can distort memories, one way or another.
",-1
"Whatever happened or did not happen, it's difficult to feel sorry for someone who comes forward at such a politically opportune moment.
",-1
"Democrats may be overestimating the strength of their hand.
",-1
"Ford can choose to state her case on Monday or not, but she is not in a position to be calling the shots.

",-1
"— Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) September 21, 2018
",-1
"More from the Washington Times:
",-1
"Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, has championed Brett Kavanaugh’s #MeToo accuser, but Juanita Broaddrick says the senator never showed any interest in her 1999 rape allegation against President Bill Clinton.
",-1
"Ms. Feinstein was elected in 1992, making her one of the few remaining senators who served during independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s investigation into Mr. Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
",-1
"“Not one Democrat would look at my deposition with the independent counsel.
",-1
"“Oh, it makes me go back to 1999, when Dianne Feinstein, along with every other Democrat, refused to read my deposition to the independent counsel,” said Ms. Broaddrick told Fox’s Laura Ingraham on Monday.
",-1
"“They would have nothing to do with it.

"“You voted NOT GUILTY on both counts at Bill Clinton’s impeachment,” she tweeted.

",-1
"let’s investigate my RAPE allegations against Bill Clinton, too.
",-1
"Seems only fair.
",-1
"She has long accused Mr. Clinton of raping her a motel room in 1978 in Little Rock, when he was Arkansas attorney general.
",-1
"“Go back that far, let’s investigate my situation,” she said on Wednesday.
",-1
"“Why not?
",-1
"Everybody says well it was litigated and adjudicated—my case was never litigated, it was never adjudicated.
",-1
"It never went to court.
",-1
"The allegation went public last week after Ms. Feinstein, ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she received a letter about the incident in late July and referred the matter to federal authorities a week ago.
",-1
"“She knew this would have a huge effect on her life and she was incredibly brave to come forward.”

"President Trump nominated Bret Kavanaugh to the supreme court.
",-1
"The power that the Supreme Court has, some would argue, is greater in certain aspects than that of the president himself.

",-1
"The most suspicious part of this whole situation is the timing.
",-1
"Christine Ford recalled the incident in 2006
",-1
"She's known about this for over ten years, why come forward now?
",-1
"She's affiliated with the democratic party and the “resist” movement
",-1
"She hired a Clinton attorney, Lisa Banks
",-1
"She can produce exactly zero witnesses

"Any one of these (and dozens of other) circumstances by themselves are not enough to dismiss this allegation outright.

"Ladies, you demand to be believed, no matter what.
",-1
"No, an accusation against a man who has been investigated by the FBI six times prior and has 75 women publicly vouching for his character is not going to stop this process.

"Immediately every Democrat publicly stated that they would vote No for his confirmation.
",-1
"On the other hand, every Republican publicly stated that they would vote Yes.
",-1
"Currently, there's more Republicans in Congress than Democrats, which means the guy will be confirmed.

"There's an election 2 months away.
",-1
"The Democrats think that they'll take back the majority of Congress and will thus be able to block Trump's nomination.

"Kavanaugh and Last-Minute Accusations
",-1
"On Sunday, a former classmate from Judge Kavanaugh's time at Yale accused the Supreme Court nominee of exposing himself to her at a party.
",-1
"The New Yorker has just published an article written by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer, based on information that was reportedly sent to at least four Democratic senators.
",-1
"The article recounted a claim by Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Brett Kavanaugh’s, concerning “a dormitory party gone awry.” As the article acknowledged, however, “her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident.” The article goes on to say that in her initial conversations with The New Yorker, Ms. Ramirez was “reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh’s role in the alleged incident with certainty.” It was only after “six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney” that Ms. Ramirez was suddenly able to pinpoint Judge Kavanaugh as having committed an unsavory act, even though she admitted being “foggy” at the time.
",-1
"The New Yorker article also noted that the magazine “has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party.”
",-1
"Meanwhile, the ever-present Michael Avenatti, attorney of porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted that he had information from anonymous sources that Judge Kavanaugh and his friend had ""targeted"" women with drugs and alcohol at parties to facilitate ""gang rape.""
",-1
"While Judge Kavanaugh weathers these latest accusations, which he adamantly denies, his real test will be on Thursday, assuming that Christine Blasey Ford will follow through on her agreement to testify at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
",-1
"Her attorneys stalled for a week before making the announcement that Ms. Ford would testify despite certain “unresolved” issues.
",-1
"Among the issues Ms. Ford’s attorneys have raised was the refusal of the committee to subpoena one of the purported witnesses, Mark Judge, who Ms. Ford reportedly claims was involved in the alleged incident, as well as “who on the Majority side will be asking the questions, whether senators or staff attorneys.""
",-1
"A week has already gone by since Ms. Ford went public with her story in an interview with the Washington Post while Ms. Ford and her attorneys stalled for time.
",-1
"They raised one procedural issue after another while claiming that the committee majority was “bullying” Ms. Ford.
",-1
"He extended the deadline several times for her to come to a decision on whether to testify at all.
",-1
"He had offered various options for her to testify publicly or privately or to be interviewed by committee staff in her home state of California, whichever setting would make her more comfortable.
",-1
"However, in Senator Grassley’s e-mail thanking Ms. Ford for finally agreeing to a time certain for her testimony, Senator Grassley correctly reminded her attorneys that “the committee determines which witnesses to call, how many witnesses to call, and what order to call them and who will question them.
",-1
"These are nonnegotiable.”
",-1
"Some Democrats are already using the Ramirez episode to push anew for a fresh FBI investigation and to postpone Thursday’s scheduled hearing.
",-1
"Then they will claim that the newly elected senators should be involved in the confirmation decision.
",-1
"All of their stratagems are an obvious attempt to buy time in order to persuade any wavering senators that Judge Kavanaugh is too tainted by sexual assault charges – whether proven or not - to sit on the Supreme Court.
",-1
"Proof does not matter to those wanting to bring Judge Kavanaugh down at any cost.
",-1
"Regarding Ms. Ford’s accusation, they know that the proof so far is non-existent, aside from Ms. Ford’s own assertions contained in her confidential letter given to Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, last July, and in her Washington Post interview.
",-1
"While a redacted version of Ms. Ford’s letter has been published, Senator Feinstein has refused to date to give even Senator Grassley a copy of the completely unredacted version.
",-1
"The FBI has already conducted 6 background checks, no federal crime is alleged, and there is no forensic evidence to investigate after 30 years at a site that Ms. Ford cannot even identify.
",-1
"Ms. Ford cannot corroborate her decades-old charge of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh.
",-1
"The individuals she reportedly named in her unredacted confidential letter given to Senator Feinstein have either denied being at such a party or do not recollect what Ms. Ford has alleged.
",-1
"Moreover, by her own admission to the Washington Post, Ms. Ford “said she does not remember some key details of the incident.” She does not remember, for example, where it happened, how the party came together in the first place, or how she got home after the alleged incident.
",-1
"She believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, but reportedly could not be more precise on the day or even the month of the party.
",-1
"Moreover, when Ms. Ford finally told someone about the incident in any detail some 30 years later in 2012, during a couples therapy session with her husband, she did not name Judge Kavanaugh specifically, according to the therapist’s notes that Ms. Ford had provided to the Washington Post in connection with her interview.
",-1
"Ms. Ramirez’s story is even less credible.
",-1
"It took an attorney and six days of very belated reflection to help revive her memory of an incident she claimed happened while she herself was very drunk.
",-1
"Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is also suffering from the same syndrome.
",-1
"The same would presumably be the case for Ms. Ramirez.
",-1
"They argue that since the Senate Judiciary Committee is not a criminal judicial trial, but rather a legislative hearing for confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee, the normal burden of proof shouldered by the accuser should not apply.
",-1
"Judge Kavanaugh should have to prove that he is not guilty, they are in effect insisting.
",-1
"Let’s assume for the sake of argument that the normal burden on the prosecution in a criminal case - to prove the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt - is not applicable regarding the charge against Judge Kavanaugh since he is not a defendant in a criminal trial.
",-1
"However, that should not flip the burden of proof onto Judge Kavanaugh altogether.
",-1
"Judge Kavanaugh is being subjected to charges of a criminal nature that could not only deprive him of a seat on the Supreme Court for which he is otherwise eminently qualified.
",-1
"His family’s lives have been completely upended.
",-1
"Ms. Ford should have the burden to prove her accusations by at least a preponderance of all the evidence presented.
",-1
"No more extensions for Ms. Ford to come forward and testify.
",-1
"If Ms. Ford does not follow through with her agreement to testify in an open Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this Thursday and do so upon the conditions set by the committee, she should go home while the committee proceeds to an immediate vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination.
",-1
"If Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh do testify, the senators deciding on whether to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as well as the American public following the testimony must remember one cardinal rule.
",-1
"Delay is not an option.
",-1
"The new allegations came yesterday amid reports that Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tentatively scheduled a hearing for this Thursday to take testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, sexually assaulted her decades ago when he was a high school student.
",-1
"After stalling Grassley and getting repeated extensions, the attorneys got the chairman to cave on various demands, such as that Kavanaugh not be in the room when Ford gives evidence.
",-1
"Republicans never seem to learn from their mistakes.
",-1
"As usual, Republicans’ seeming reasonableness is rewarded with more abuse by the Left.
",-1
"Democrats, it turns out, used the extra time created through their delaying tactics to produce two new women with questionable claims against Kavanaugh.
",-1
"More accusers could be on their way.
",-1
"President Trump continues to support Kavanaugh, who maintains his innocence.
",-1
"“This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,” the nominee said Sunday of Ford’s accusations.
",-1
"“The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so.
",-1
"I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name — and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building — against these last-minute allegations.”
",-1
"If Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench on October 1, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.
",-1
"The high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have only been only eight justices in place.
",-1
"Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they stand a good chance of taking control from Republicans.
",-1
"Meanwhile, the New Yorker magazine reported Sunday that Deborah Ramirez, 53, suddenly claims to have been assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College.
",-1
"Ramirez claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.
",-1
"“I represent a woman with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh and Mark Judge.
",-1
"We will be demanding the opportunity to present testimony to the committee and will likewise be demanding that Judge and others be subpoenaed to testify,” Avenatti wrote on Twitter.
",-1
"“My client is not Deborah Ramirez.”
",-1
"Washington insiders still believe Kavanaugh will be confirmed, or at least they did before the two new accusers popped up.
",-1
"For example, at a Friday afternoon preview of upcoming cases in the Supreme Court’s approaching October term that was hosted by the Federalist Society, panelist Thomas C. Goldstein of the law firm of Goldstein & Russell predicted that the high court would have nine members again soon.
",-1
"“I think we ought to recognize that.
",-1
"The prospect that the Democrats will take the Senate, albeit thin, is realistic, and so they will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure that there is a ninth member of the court there by the time a Democratic majority could take over in the Senate in January.”
",-1
"We’ll see soon enough if Goldstein’s prediction comes true.
",-1
"Stop Appeasing the Democrats
",-1
"Bruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center.
",-1
"From the playground to geopolitics, appeasing an aggressor invites only more aggression.
",-1
"This timeless truth of human nature is one that we moderns can’t seem to accept.
",-1
"Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court illustrate that this false assumption leads only to more demands, and ultimately to defeat.
",-1
"Feinstein still hasn’t given the Judiciary Committee an unredacted copy of the letter.
",-1
"A few weeks after Ford went public, and after Kavanaugh said he had dairies from that summer detailing his whereabouts, The New Yorker published Ramirez’s account of a drunken party filled with obscene drinking games where he exposed himself to Ramirez.
",-1
"Of course, after each concession comes another demand.
",-1
"Wait until Dr. Ford feels that she can come before the committee.” Ford doesn’t “feel” like she can testify on Monday because she’s afraid of flying, despite offers from the Committee to travel to her in California.
",-1
"Then she feared for her life because of death threats ––threats also made to Kavanaugh, his wife and two young daughters–– so she now demands enhanced security measures.
",-1
"The Committee caved and moved the date to Thursday.
",-1
"So of course, Grassley having been intimidated into giving Ford a chance to address the Committee, Ramirez and her handlers are now demanding the same privilege.
",-1
"Ford and Dianne Feinstein also keep demanding an FBI investigation, even though no federal crime is being alleged, and any investigation 36 years after the offense is impossible.
",-1
"Ford can’t remember where and when the alleged assault took place, nor how she got to or went home from the party where it allegedly occurred.
",-1
"Her own details of the event don’t jibe (Four boys or three?
",-1
"One girl or two?).
",-1
"She told no one about the assault until 30 years later.
",-1
"A “lifelong friend” whom Ford claims was at the party has denied any knowledge of the it, and says she’s never met Kavanaugh.
",-1
"Another friend who reported that the school was abuzz with gossip about the attack (which apparently took place during summer break), retracted her statement.
",-1
"The two men Ford named as possible witnesses to the assault have contradicter her claims under oath.
",-1
"Given that 36 years have passed since the incident, and the accuser’s memory is so hazy and short on coherent details, the FBI has nothing to investigate.
",-1
"Ramirez’s charge is even flimsier.
",-1
"Here’s a catalogue from the Daily Wire:
",-1
"The New Yorker could not find a single witness who could put Kavanaugh at the alleged party.
",-1
"The New York Times could not find a single person who could corroborate Ramirez’s claims.
",-1
"The man accused of egging on Kavanaugh denied Ramirez's allegations and vouched for Kavanaugh’s character.
",-1
"A third person that Ramirez claimed was at the party says she was not there for the alleged incident.
",-1
"Ramirez contacted her former classmates, asking about the incident, and admitted she was not sure that Kavanaugh was the male who exposed himself.
",-1
"A woman who claims she was “best friends” with Ramirez says Ramirez never mentioned the story and initially said her friend's accusations against Kavanaugh might be “politically motivated.”
",-1
"Ramirez, just like Christine Blasey Ford, is a registered Democrat and is dedicated to leftist causes.
",-1
"Ramirez admits there are holes in her memory due to how much she drank at the party.
",-1
"10.
",-1
"People who knew Ramirez after her time at Yale say that she never once mentioned the incident — until Kavanaugh's nomination was pending.
",-1
"No law enforcement agency, let alone the FBI, would waste its time with an allegation of a crime decades in the past, and so patently incoherent and lacking in evidence.
",-1
"The “FBI investigation” is another delaying tactic.
",-1
"Ford has finally agreed to testify, set for Thursday for now.
",-1
"Only one camera can be in the room.
",-1
"He can’t be in the room with her, apparently because she’s still traumatized and may start experiencing flashbacks.
",-1
"Grassley shouldn’t cave on these conditions.
",-1
"They all comprise the old tactic of serially escalating demands that cannot be satisfied in order to compel your enemy to give in.
",-1
"If Ford actually testifies on Thursday, or Ramirez is granted the same concession, nothing material will be gained.
",-1
"Her accusation will not be proved true or false.
",-1
"But vetting Kavanaugh’s qualifications isn’t the point.
",-1
"The point is to delay confirmation by slandering Kavanaugh and baiting the Republicans into appearing to abuse victims of sexual assault.
",-1
"The courts and especially the Supreme Court have been critical to the progressives’ program since Woodrow Wilson.
",-1
"The biggest obstacle to the progressive dream of government controlled and managed by a technocratic oligarchy has been the Constitution.
",-1
"Its divided and balanced powers were designed precisely to rein in overreaching ambition and concentrations of power.
",-1
"Hence the Constitutional order must be subverted by the Supreme Court and its unaccountable justices enjoying lifelong tenure.
",-1
"But if Kavanaugh is confirmed, there will be five reliably Constitutionalist justices on the bench, who are unlikely to tolerate judicial usurpation of Congress’s law-making powers.
",-1
"The irony is that today’s feminists have been willing to sacrifice the earlier narrative of female power and agency that had been stifled by traditional views of the sexes and their capabilities.
",-1
"Women have exchanged one form of dependence, and one double standard for another.
",-1
"It’s the new third rail of American politics, one that transcends party affiliation.
",-1
"Hence the widespread virtue-signaling on the part even of conservative writers who preface their comments about Ford and Ramirez with prologues full of truisms about how horrible sexual assault is, how its self-proclaimed victims “must be heard,” and how churlish and sexist it is to question the truth of any charge.
",-1
"Grown-ups know all that and don’t have to be reminded every time the subject arises.
",-1
"The progressive party can dare the Republicans to ignore the endless specious demands, stop the show-trial, and proceed to a vote on Kavanaugh, because they know the Republicans, fearful of the “optics,” will cave.
",-1
"Just stop holding them.
",-1
"Invite written questions from the Senate, then schedule one day for the nominee to respond.
",-1
"Don’t put it on television, but make public a written transcript.
",-1
"No more concessions.
",-1
"No more delays.
",-1
"Don’t give Ramirez the time of day.
",-1
"Hold the vote no later than Thursday, or Friday if Ford does show up.
",-1
"Make Senators go on the record with their votes, and hold them to account in November.
",-1
"Whether the claims are true is irrelevant to these people.
",-1
"Only the seriousness and luridness of the charges matter as they get aired over and over again in the 24-hour news cycle.
",-1
"They don’t care about the victims they create.
",-1
"Only the headlines.
",-1
"The third accuser is Julie Swetnick, a 55-year-old certified systems engineer, who on Wednesday claimed that in the early 1980s Kavanaugh and others spiked the drinks of young women at high school parties with intoxicants to clear the way for them to be gang-raped.
",-1
"Incredibly, Swetnick said in a sworn statement that she witnessed gang rapes at these parties but kept on attending them anyway.
",-1
"It gets weirder.
",-1
"He drank excessively at these parties and would grind against girls and try to take their clothing of, she said.
",-1
"""I don't know who this is and this never happened,"" the judicial nominee added.
",-1
"A CNBC summary describes Swetnick:
",-1
"A 1980 graduate of Gaithersburg High School in Maryland, she said she has held multiple clearances for work done at the Treasury Department, U.S. Mint, IRS, State Department and Justice Department, among other government agencies.
",-1
"Swetnick says in her affidavit that she saw Kavanaugh in the early 1980s ""drink excessively at many"" house parties in suburban Maryland.
",-1
"At the time, Kavanaugh and Judge were students at Georgetown Prep, a private Catholic all-boys school.
",-1
"She said Kavanaugh and Judge engaged in ""abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls,"" which ""included the fondling and groping of girls without their consent"" and ""not taking 'No' for an answer.""
",-1
"Predictably, all 10 Democrat members of the Judiciary Committee urged President Trump to either ""immediately withdraw the nomination or order an FBI investigation into all the allegations.""
",-1
"There is no indication so far that the president will oblige them.
",-1
"""There should be an immediate investigation"" of Swetnick’s dramatic allegations, Avenatti said on MSNBC, ""and there should be no rush to confirm him to the U.S. Supreme Court.""
",-1
"“All of a sudden, the hearings are over, and the rumors start coming out,” Trump said.
",-1
"A fourth accuser popped up yesterday, Politico reports.
",-1
"According to an interview transcript released Wednesday night by the Senate Judiciary Committee:
",-1
"An anonymous woman wrote to Sen. Cory Gardner’s (R-Colo.) office on Sept. 22 alleging that the Supreme Court nominee shoved another woman “up against the wall very aggressively and sexually” in 1998 after leaving a bar where both had been drinking, the transcript states.
",-1
"Kavanaugh denied any involvement in the events alleged in that complaint, which was first reported by NBC.
",-1
"Depending on how you do the counting, there may even be a fifth and sixth accusation against Kavanaugh.
",-1
"The newspaper account continues:
",-1
"The transcript of Kavanaugh's Tuesday interview also cited another anonymous claim of sexual misconduct involving Kavanaugh, dating back to 1985 and sent to the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), which the judge also flatly denied to investigators.
",-1
"And GOP investigators said late Wednesday they received an additional anonymous claim of rape passed along by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).
",-1
"Accuser number two is Deborah Ramirez, 53, who went public with her claims in a New Yorker magazine article Sunday.
",-1
"Ramirez alleges she was assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College.
",-1
"She claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.
",-1
"If Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.
",-1
"It normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have been only eight justices.
",-1
"Democrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they may seize control from Republicans.
",-1
"The proceedings Thursday are supposed to get underway at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.
",-1
"“It is going against everything I’ve seen for 44 years,"" huffed committee member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.).
",-1
"""They’re not following normal procedure.""
",-1
"As expected, at today’s hearing Kavanaugh will firmly rebut the increasingly outrageous claims being leveled at him.
",-1
"According to prepared testimony provided to The Hill newspaper, he will say:
",-1
"I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford.
",-1
"I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time.
",-1
"But I have never done that to her or to anyone.
",-1
"Kavanaugh added: ""I am innocent of this charge.""
",-1
"Not surprisingly Ford’s prepared testimony also found its way to reporters.
",-1
"“I am here today not because I want to be,” Ford says in her opening statement.
",-1
"I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.”
",-1
"Many commentators have drawn parallels between Ford and Anita Hill, who in 1991 accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual improprieties.
",-1
"Both women are college professors.
",-1
"Both claim to have reluctantly been drawn into confirmation battles.
",-1
"Ford claims to be a victim of attempted rape; Hill claims to have been a victim of sexual harassment in the workplace.
",-1
"An abused person wouldn’t do that.
",-1
"In the end, the Senate barely approved his nomination 52 to 48 on October 15, 1991.
",-1
"If they can derail Kavanaugh’s nomination, that is an added bonus.

"The Left’s attacks on Kavanaugh in the #MeToo era are working, a USA Today article suggests:
",-1
"Disapproval for Kavanaugh … is at an unprecedented level for a Supreme Court nominee amid the allegations against him, according to a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Public Affairs Poll.
",-1
"Those surveyed said by 40 percent to 31 percent that the Senate shouldn't vote to approve his nomination, the first time a plurality of Americans have opposed a Supreme Court nominee since polling on the issue began.
",-1
"That said, the Senate Judiciary Committee is tentatively scheduled to vote on the nomination Friday at 9:30 a.m.

"*****
",-1
"It has been a month since I offered my testimony, solely for the good of the Church, regarding what occurred at the audience with Pope Francis on June 23, 2013 and regarding certain matters I was given to know in the assignments entrusted to me at the Secretariat of State and in Washington, in relation to those who bear responsibility for covering up the crimes committed by the former archbishop of that capital.
",-1
"Well aware of the enormous consequences that my testimony could have, because what I was about to reveal involved the successor of Peter himself, I nonetheless chose to speak in order to protect the Church, and I declare with a clear conscience before God that my testimony is true.
",-1
"Christ died for the Church, and Peter, Servus servorum Dei, is the first one called to serve the spouse of Christ.
",-1
"Certainly, some of the facts that I was to reveal were covered by the pontifical secret that I had promised to observe and that I had faithfully observed from the beginning of my service to the Holy See.
",-1
"But the purpose of any secret, including the pontifical secret, is to protect the Church from her enemies, not to cover up and become complicit in crimes committed by some of her members.
",-1
"2491), the seal of secrecy is not binding when very grave harm can be avoided only by divulging the truth.
",-1
"Only the seal of confession could have justified my silence.
",-1
"Neither the pope, nor any of the cardinals in Rome have denied the facts I asserted in my testimony.
",-1
"“Qui tacet consentit” surely applies here, for if they deny my testimony, they have only to say so, and provide documentation to support that denial.
",-1
"If he had said: “Viganò lied,” he would have challenged my credibility while trying to affirm his own.
",-1
"In so doing he would have intensified the demand of the people of God and the world for the documentation needed to determine who has told the truth.
",-1
"Instead, he put in place a subtle slander against me — slander being an offense he has often compared to the gravity of murder.
",-1
"Indeed, he did it repeatedly, in the context of the celebration of the most Holy Sacrament, the Eucharist, where he runs no risk of being challenged by journalists.
",-1
"When he did speak to journalists, he asked them to exercise their professional maturity and draw their own conclusions.
",-1
"Moreover, the pope’s cover-up of McCarrick was clearly not an isolated mistake.
",-1
"These include his role in the case of Fr.
",-1
"Julio Grassi in Buenos Aires, his reinstatement of Fr.
",-1
"Mauro Inzoli after Pope Benedict had removed him from ministry (until he went to prison, at which point Pope Francis laicized him), and his halting of the investigation of sex abuse allegations against Cardinal Cormac Murphy O’Connor.
",-1
"In the meantime, a delegation of the USCCB, headed by its president Cardinal DiNardo, went to Rome asking for a Vatican investigation into McCarrick.
",-1
"I would like to make a special appeal to Cardinal Ouellet, because as nuncio I always worked in great harmony with him, and I have always had great esteem and affection towards him.
",-1
"He will remember when, at the end of my mission in Washington, he received me at his apartment in Rome in the evening for a long conversation.
",-1
"At the beginning of Pope Francis’ pontificate, he had maintained his dignity, as he had shown with courage when he was Archbishop of Québec.
",-1
"Your Eminence, before I left for Washington, you were the one who told me of Pope Benedict’s sanctions on McCarrick.
",-1
"You have at your complete disposal key documents incriminating McCarrick and many in the curia for their cover-ups.
",-1
"Your Eminence, I urge you to bear witness to the truth.
",-1
"Make your own the act of faith and complete confidence in Christ Jesus, our Savior, of Saint Paul in his second Letter to Timothy, Scio cui credidi, which I choose as my episcopal motto.

"MSM Using Kavanaugh Sex Scandal to Distract You From Real Reason He Shouldn’t Be Confirmed
",-1
"In July, President Donald Trump nominated D.C.
",-1
"Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
",-1
"Since then, there have been numerous allegations of sexual misconduct levied toward the Justice to be.
",-1
"Whether or not he is guilty of these allegations is left to be determined.
",-1
"But no one is talking about this.
",-1
"On multiple occasions, Kavanaugh has been the lone voice when it comes supporting the state’s rights to warrantlessly spy on its citizens.
",-1
"As Reason points out, in 2010 he dissented from the D.C. Circuit’s decision not to rehear a case in which a three-judge panel had ruled that police violated a suspected drug dealer’s Fourth Amendment rights when they tracked his movements for a month by attaching a GPS device to his car without a warrant.
",-1
"Kavanaugh claimed that putting a GPS tracking device on a person’s car without first obtaining a warrant was just fine because it didn’t constitute a “search” as defined by the Fourth Amendment.
",-1
"To Kavanaugh, bypassing the courts and tracking an individual without their consent is “constitutional.” In this line of thinking, the Fourth Amendment is not violated even if police trespass on someone’s physical property, or track someone’s cell phone.
",-1
"Luckily, he was the only judge on the panel to think this.
",-1
"In June, the Supreme Court ruled specifically on this case noting that collecting such information actually does constitute a search and therefore requires a warrant.
",-1
"But it gets worse.
",-1
"In 2015, Kavanaugh issued a statement strongly defending the NSA’s phone metadata collection program, arguing that it is “entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.” To Kavanaugh, sweeping programs that collect information from innocent citizens’ phones are not in conflict with having the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure.
",-1
"According to Kavanaugh, the Fourth Amendment allows for searches “without individualized suspicion” when the government demonstrates a “special need” that “outweighs the intrusion on individual liberty.”
",-1
"“The sacrifice of our personal liberty for security is and will forever be a false choice,” Senator Rand Paul said of Kavanaugh’s views on the disposable nature of the constitution.
",-1
"Kavanaugh “has no qualms about applying decades-old case law to the digital age, and he has endorsed the idea of a “counterterrorism exception” to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement,” said Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program.
",-1
"Representative Justin Amash does not have a vote on whether or not Kavanaugh will be appointed.
",-1
"However, this hasn’t prevented him from becoming the only Republican to speak out against the real reasons he should not be appointed to Supreme Court.
",-1
"“There are many potential nominees with a conservative record on abortion, guns, and regulations.
",-1
"Indeed, as technology increases, so does the desire of the state to use it to spy on us.
",-1
"The cases headed to the supreme court in the future over what constitutes an unconstitutional search will undoubtedly be vast in number and detrimental in deciding how much freedom and privacy Americans get to keep.

"Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?
",-1
"Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s outstanding performance at yesterday’s evidentiary hearing featuring attempted rape accuser Christine Blasey Ford may have revived his embattled nomination for the highest court in America.
",-1
"The meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee showed the underhanded tactics employed by the Left against Judge Kavanaugh.
",-1
"President Trump was delighted.
",-1
"“Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him[,]” President Trump tweeted at 6:46 p.m. after the hearing wrapped up.
",-1
"“His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting.
",-1
"Ford, who claims Kavanaugh tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for several hours Thursday.
",-1
"Kavanaugh testified separately after Ford’s testimony concluded.
",-1
"The behavior of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment.
",-1
"But at least it was just a good old-fashioned attempt at Borking.
",-1
"Those efforts didn't work.
",-1
"When I did at least okay enough at the hearings that it looked like I might actually get confirmed, a new tactic was needed.
",-1
"Some of you were lying in wait and had it ready.
",-1
"This first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee, and by staff.
",-1
"It would be needed only if you couldn't take me out on the merits.
",-1
"When it was needed, this allegation was unleashed and publicly deployed over Dr. Ford's wishes.
",-1
"Opinions differ widely on how Mitchell performed.
",-1
"She tiptoed around the alleged sexual assault itself, instead focusing on process-related questions, presumably in an effort to show undecided senators how Ford and her handlers have been unfairly manipulating the process.
",-1
"Ford did well enough that during the break between her testimony and Kavanaugh’s, commentators on Fox News such as Brit Hume and Andrew Napolitano were openly musing about the nominee withdrawing, opinions that were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later.
",-1
"It’s not that Mitchell did a bad job creating an inventory of the irregularities in the process and of the odd behavior of Ford and her lawyers.
",-1
"She could do little else.
",-1
"She had many restrictions placed upon her and was only allowed to question Ford for minutes at a time before surrendering the floor to the next committee Democrat.
",-1
"As commentator Sean Davis tweeted:
",-1
"Nonetheless, Mitchell’s questioning came across at times as perfunctory, leading many observers to conclude that Republicans threw away a valuable opportunity by using her as a stand-in.
",-1
"In the end the too-deferential, easygoing Mitchell failed to provide much, if anything, in the way of evidence against Ford or in favor of Kavanaugh.
",-1
"Whether her work will bring over fence-sitting senators to Kavanaugh’s side remains to be seen.
",-1
"“No, and I'd like to reiterate that again, I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of other what looked like equally-qualified candidates,” Ford replied.
",-1
"When Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Ford “with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?” Ford replied, “one hundred percent.”
",-1
"She doesn’t know when or where the alleged incident took place, yet she is “one hundred percent” certain it was Kavanaugh who attacked her.
",-1
"At the outset of the hearing, Grassley provided an overview of what Kavanaugh had gone through –including the Democrats’ sordid behavior— since President Trump announced the judge’s nomination on July 9.
",-1
"As part of the confirmation process, Kavanaugh endured his sixth background investigation since 1993.
",-1
"Ford shared her allegations in a letter to the committee’s ranking member, Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), in the summer.
",-1
"The letter remained secret from July 30 through until September 13 when he first learned about it, the chairman said.
",-1
"Instead of sharing the letter with the committee, Feinstein did nothing.
",-1
"Before the hearing, Kavanaugh met privately with 65 senators, including Feinstein, who didn’t ask him about the allegations when she met with him in August.
",-1
"The committee held a four-day public hearing from September 4 to September 7 during which Kavanaugh testified for more than 32 hours in public.
",-1
"Feinstein didn’t attend it, Grassley said.
",-1
"Kavanaugh answered almost 1,300 written questions senators submitted after the hearing.
",-1
"That is “more than all prior Supreme Court nominees,” he said.
",-1
"“Throughout this period, we did not know about the ranking member's secret evidence.
",-1
"Then, only at an 11th hour, on the eve of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation vote, did the ranking member refer the allegations to the FBI.
",-1
"And then, sadly, the allegations were leaked to the press.”
",-1
"“Every step of the way the Democratic side refused to participate in what should have been a bipartisan investigation,” Grassley said.
",-1
"After Ford’s identity became public, Grassley’s staff “contacted all the individuals she said attended the 1982 party described in the Washington Post article,” he said.
",-1
"Kavanaugh “immediately submitted to an interview under penalty of felony for any knowingly false statements.
",-1
"He denied the allegations categorically.”
",-1
"“Democratic staff was invited to participate and could have asked any questions they wanted to, but they declined.
",-1
"Grassley said his staff contacted the other individuals who allegedly attended the party at which the conduct Ford complained of allegedly took place: Mark Judge, Patrick Smyth, and Leland Keyser.
",-1
"“All three submitted statements to the Senate under – under penalty of felony, denying any knowledge of the events described by Dr. Ford.
",-1
"Dr. Ford's lifelong friend, Dr. – Miss Keyser, stated she doesn't know Judge Kavanaugh and doesn't recall ever attending a party with him.”
",-1
"Grassley said his staff repeatedly sought to interview Ford over the past 11 days, “even volunteering to fly to California to take her testimony, but her attorneys refused to prevent – present her allegations to Congress.”
",-1
"“Consistent with their stated desires to obstruct Kavanaugh's nomination” by any means possible, “pushed for FBI investigations into the allegations.”
",-1
"“We've been trying to investigate other allegations,” Grassley said.
",-1
"“At this time, we have not had cooperation from attorneys representing other clients, and they have made no attempt to substantiate their claims.”
",-1
"Attorneys for new Kavanaugh accusers Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick have been approached by committee staff on eight and six occasions, respectively, Grassley said.
",-1
"“Neither attorney has made their clients available for interview.
",-1
"Lashing out at Democrats, Graham said, “If you wanted an FBI investigation, you could have come to us.
",-1
"“God, I hope you never get it.
",-1
"Graham warned fellow GOPers about voting against the nomination.
",-1
"You want this seat?
",-1
"“It certainly has brought us no closer to the truth,” Hatch added.
",-1
"“I hate to say this, but this is worse than Robert Bork, and I didn't think it could get any worse than that.
",-1
"This is worse than Clarence Thomas.
",-1
"I didn't think it could get any worse than that.
",-1
"This is a national disgrace, the way you're being treated.”
",-1
"The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on the nomination today at 9:30 a.m.
",-1
"Asked last night about the nomination moving to the floor of the Senate for a final vote, Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) reportedly answered, ""Depends on what happens tomorrow.""
",-1
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is planning a procedural vote on Saturday to formally move to the nomination, followed by a potential confirmation vote by the full Senate as soon as Tuesday, Politico reports.
",-1
"Democrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they hope to seize control from Republicans.
",-1
"The confirmation drama continues.
",-1
"Senate Judiciary Committee Vote To Send Kavanaugh Nomination To The Floor
",-1
"The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-10 along party lines to advance the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh out of committee to the Senate floor for a vote.
",-1
"Of course, RINO Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) wanted to side with Senate Democrats in pushing for a FBI investigation into unsubstantiated allegations against Kavanaugh.
",-1
"Flake said that he believed it would be proper to delay the floor vote to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation ""limited in time"" to no more than one week.
",-1
"He added that he would be more ""comfortable"" with an FBI investigation.
",-1
"Comfort?
",-1
"It's a good thing he'll be leaving the Senate.
",-1
"Why that investigation is needed is unclear since all the people Dr. Christine Ford named to be at the alleged house where the alleged attack took place all categorically denied the attack took place, including Ford's girl friend.
",-1
"The committee also voted against Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and his motion to subpoena Mark Judge before the committee.
",-1
"I'll Say What Kavanaugh Wouldn't: Christine Ford Was Part Of The Political Hit On Him & Here's The Audio Evidence
",-1
"I don't say this lightly.
",-1
"There are many things that we heard from Ford on Thursday that indicate there is more going on than she was willing to say.
",-1
"However, Ford claims she never authorized her July letter to Senator Feinstein to be made public and yet, it was.
",-1
"She didn't seem distraught over that.
",-1
"She wasn't angry it was made public.
",-1
"“I do think that over the coming days and weeks there will be a strategy that will emerge, and I think it’s possible that strategy might ultimately defeat the nominee,” Seidman said in audio that was recorded by the Republican National Committee’s War Room.
",-1
"Kavanaugh even responded by pointing out that even her friends said they don't recall such an incident and had literally hundreds of people commend his character as the direct opposite of what Ford claims.
",-1
"It's wrong.
",-1
"Nope.
",-1
"She went to her US Democrat representative, Senator Dianne Feinstein and The Washington Post.
",-1
"If that is not political, I don't know what is.
",-1
"Ford is not seeking justice nor is she seeking to do her ""civic duty.""
",-1
"She is seeking to slander a man's character for something she cannot prove that she claims happened over 36 years ago.
",-1
"Kavanaugh's nomination was passed out of committee on Friday and will go to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote.
",-1
"For a quick run down of the political hit on Kavanaugh, take a look at this short synopsis by Paul Joseph Watson.
",-1
"“I’ve ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh’s file.
",-1
"As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week,” the president said in a statement.
",-1
"The scope and one-week limitations were what Senator Jeff Flake proposed just prior to the vote that passed the Kavanaugh nomination out of committee and to the Senate for a vote on his confirmation.
",-1
"On top of that, there has been zero evidence submitted to the committee that Ford's allegations are true.
",-1
"In fact, everything submitted has refuted her claims, from sworn statements by those she claims were there to Kavanaugh's calendar to character statements by dozens of women who have known him since high school to those he has worked with in DC.
",-1
"All of the people named by Ford have already submitted statements that they have no memory of the event ever occurring, including a female friend of hers at the time.
",-1
"Two of those named have stated that they will cooperate with the FBI.
",-1
"“I will cooperate with any law enforcement agency that is assigned to confidentially investigate these allegations,” Kavanaugh friend Mark Judge said.
",-1
"“My client, Patrick J. Smyth, is happy to cooperate fully with this FBI investigation,” said attorney Eric B. Bruce.
",-1
"Kavanaugh also said he would be cooperating as he has in the past.
",-1
"“Throughout this process, I’ve been interviewed by the FBI, I’ve done a number of ‘background’ calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me,"" Kavanaugh said in a statement that was released by the White House.
",-1
"""I’ve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate.""
",-1
"Well, Senator Flake has given the Democrats what they wanted and you can bet that they are still going to vote pretty much on party lines concerning Kavanaugh.
",-1
"Now, President Trump has gone along with it.
",-1
"Dina Powell, a Valerie Jarrett/Huma Abedin Pal, Should Not Be UN Ambassador
",-1
"President Trump came in promising to drain the swamp.
",-1
"You can see her out there at the Clinton Global Initiative, next to Samantha Power, palling around with Valerie Jarrett or Huma Abedin.
",-1
"Dina Habib Powell was an influential figure in the Bush administration.
",-1
"The Egyptian-American immigrant had served as a gatekeeper for George W. Bush.
",-1
"If you wanted a job, you went through her.
",-1
"Barely 30, Habib Powell had more power than many of the big Bush era names you do know.
",-1
"Then she took on the mission of promoting America to the Muslim world at the State Department.
",-1
"There were cultural exchanges with Iran and money for Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority.
",-1
"Afterward it was off to make millions through philanthropy at the Goldman Sachs Foundation.

"Khalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal.

"And Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO’s Hanan Ashrawi.
",-1
"Unlike McFarland, Habib Powell had no national security background.
",-1
"But though her parents were Christians, she had the “right” views on Islam.
",-1
"In Egypt, she had described how Bush after September 11 had, “visited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.” ""I see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year.” Habib Powell had attended such an iftar dinner.

"In that interview, Powell heaped effusive praise upon Power and can be seen nodding in agreement throughout.
",-1
"Power was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama.
",-1
"At the time, Powell – an executive with Goldman Sachs – was pushing a pet project known as 10,000 women, which is ostensibly intended to foster female entrepreneurship.
",-1
"When Powell was at Goldman Sachs, her right-hand woman in the 10,000 Women program was Noa Meyer.
",-1
"Perhaps not so coincidentally, Meyer worked in the Bill Clinton administration’s speech-writing office of then first-lady Hillary Clinton.
",-1
"Powell herself, is very comfortable with Hillary Clinton.
",-1
"In 2013, she shared a stage with Hillary at the Clinton Global Initiative.
",-1
"In fact, Barack Obama’s closest adviser Valerie Jarrett introduced Powell, who returned the introduction with effusive praise for Jarrett.
",-1
"The ex-Goldman Sachs executive has befriended Obama’s closest adviser, Valerie Jarrett.
",-1
"She is also very cozy with Hillary Clinton’s closest advisers Huma Abedin and Philippe Reines.
",-1
"Now there's once again talk of moving Dina Powell in.
",-1
"This time into Nikki Halley's old spot as UN Ambassador.
",-1
"The talk comes from the GOP establishment.
",-1
"Powell should not be at the NSC, where she replaced K.T.
",-1
"McFarland, who was qualified for the job, at the behest of H.R.
",-1
"McMaster.
",-1
"But every job for Powell is a stepping stone to the next one.
",-1
"Making Dina Powell the US Ambassador to the UN would quickly undo all the progress that Haley made.
",-1
"Haley sent a message that UN members will be punished if they push the US around.
",-1
"Dina Powell would have been a Jeb Bush appointee.
",-1
"Appointing her to the UN would give Trump, Jeb Bush's policies.
",-1
"You don't drain the swamp by appointing the swamp.
",-1
"The rumor that Dina Habib Powell is the top candidate to replace outgoing U.S.
",-1
"One hopes the rumor mill is wrong.
",-1
"Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment.
",-1
"Back in 2017, she resigned her post of Deputy National Security Adviser NSC under Islamic apologist H. R. McMaster, whose failed views she shared.
",-1
"McMaster subscribed to the Obama view that Islamic terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, despite the numerous Islamic texts and teachings that incite Muslims to wage war against unbelievers.
",-1
"McMaster went so far as to claim that devout jihadis were “irreligious.”
",-1
"McMaster forced out superb K.T.
",-1
"When President Trump finally replaced national security adviser H.R.
",-1
"Why would President Trump go back to there?
",-1
"When visiting Egypt, Habib-Powell had assured the locals of how Bush, after September 11, “visited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.” “I see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year,” she gushed.
",-1
"K.T.
",-1
"McFarland had written that “Global Islamist jihad is at war with all of Western civilization.” It’s not hard to see why McMaster pushed out McFarland and elevated Habib-Powell.
",-1
"Habib-Powell had attended the Iftar dinner with members of Muslim Brotherhood front groups.
",-1
"She was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by Hanan Ashrawi.
",-1
"Her achievements under Bush included cultural exchanges with Iran, as well as cash for the Palestinian Authority and for Lebanon after the Hezbollah war with Israel.
",-1
"While President Trump fights to restrict Muslim immigration, at his side is the woman who had once bragged onCNN, “Over 90% of student visas are now issued in under a week, and that is in the Middle East.” (CFP)
",-1
"Two separate National Security Council sources have confirmed that National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster and Deputy National Security Advisor Dina Powell have been leaking negative material about President Donald J. Trump to their allies in the anti-Trump media,
",-1
"Daniel Greenfield said this about Dina Habib Powell: “The media dubbed her the Republican Huma Abedin.
",-1
"She’s been one of the most powerful women in two Republican administrations.
",-1
"She’s friends with Valerie Jarrett….Habib Powell had all the right friends.
",-1
"And Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO’s Hanan Ashrawi….Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment.
",-1
"Her top role at the NSC represents McMaster’s vision for our approach to Islam.
",-1
"And it’s an echo of the failed approach of the Bush years.
",-1
"Flynn made the NSC into a tool that matched Trump’s vision.
",-1
"McMaster is remaking it to match Jeb Bush’s vision.”
",-1
"Powell has close ties to the Clintons.
",-1
"Breitbart:
",-1
"1 – When she served as president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Wall Street giant, Powell repeatedly partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative for a globalist women’s project that served as the centerpiece of Goldman’s foundation.
",-1
"2 – Powell’s organization joined with the Clinton Global Initiative for globalist giving projects.
",-1
"3 – Powell’s Goldman Sachs fund directly donated to the controversial Clinton Foundation.
",-1
"4 – Powell’s Goldman Sachs group worked with Hillary Clinton’s State Department in a project announced by Clinton.
",-1
"5 – Powell was a featured speaker at a Clinton Global Initiative event alongside Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chief, John Podesta.
",-1
"On May 11, 2009, Powell was one of ten speakers at a Clinton Global Initiative event co-sponsored with the Economist titled, “Global Challenges, Corporate Solutions: Creating Value for Business and Society.” Other speakers included Bill Clinton and Clinton’s former chief of staff, John Podesta, who at the time was president and chief executive officer of the George Soros-financed Center for American Progress and co-chairman of the Obama White House transition team.
",-1
"Podesta would later become chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.
",-1
"Powell also served as a panelist at the second annual Women in the World Summit in 2011, which was keynoted by Hillary Clinton.
",-1
"The summit was launched by longtime Clinton ally Tina Brown, who also founded the Daily Beast, where Powell was a contributor.
",-1
"6 – There are crossover connections between employees paid by Powell’s 10,000 Women and the Clintons.
",-1
"7 – Powell served on a global group alongside Hillary Clinton.
",-1
"8 – In coming to Goldman Sachs, Powell joined a firm that has long been deeply tied to the Clintons.
",-1
"Back in 2005
",-1
"Ambassador Nancy Powell, America’s representative in Pakistan, refused to allow the distribution in Pakistan of wanted posters, matchbooks, and other items advertising America’s $25 million reward for information leading to the capture of Mr. bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders.
",-1
"Instead, thousands of matchbooks, posters, and other material – printed at taxpayer expense and translated into Urdu, Pashto, and other local languages – remained “impounded” on American Embassy grounds from 2002 to 2004, according to Rep. Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois.
",-1
"While the American government was engaged in a number of “black” or covert intelligence activities to locate Al Qaeda leaders, Mr. Kirk said, the “white” or public efforts – which have succeeded in the past in leading to the capture of wanted terrorists – were effectively shut down in the months following the September 11 attacks.

"Dina Habib Powell: ""Not Interested"" In Replacing Nikki Haley As Ambassador To The UN
",-1
"Former Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy Dina Habia Powell is rumored to be among the top candidates to replace outgoing United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley after her resignation earlier this week.
",-1
"Powell is on the short list of Trump's considerations to fill the position.
",-1
"Others on the list include Richard Grenell, the US ambassador to Germany, who previously served as a spokesman for the US Mission to the UN, and Kelly Craft, the US ambassador to Canada.
",-1
"First, Politico reports:

"take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?
",-1
"Powell, who returned to Goldman in a senior role after leaving her job as President Donald Trump’s deputy national security adviser, is said to be strongly considering the job but also weighing family concerns.
",-1
"Powell already lives in New York, where the U.N. is based, but has young children and left the administration in part to spend more time with family.
",-1
"She is also said to be happy in her job at Goldman.
",-1
"Born in Egypt and raised in the United States, Powell is well liked by Trump as well as the president’s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
",-1
"Trump on Tuesday described Powell as a “person I would consider” when asked about her possible nomination.
",-1
"“She is under consideration.
",-1
"We have, actually, many names,” he said.
",-1
"However, according to Bloomberg, Powell isn't interested in the position.
",-1
"She says she is just fine at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
",-1
"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Dina Powell has told some colleagues that she’s leaning against leaving the firm to rejoin the Trump administration as ambassador to the United Nations, according to two people familiar with the matter.
",-1
"President Donald Trump has called Powell about the job twice, first on Sunday -- before current United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley announced her resignation -- and again on Wednesday, the people said.

"No sign of breakthrough after Pompeo meets with Saudi rulers over missing journalist
",-1
"Pompeo did not report any progress following a day of meetings in Riyadh with Saudi King Salman and his powerful son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler.
",-1
"In his meetings, Pompeo conveyed “U.S.
",-1
"concern” about Khashoggi’s disappearance two weeks ago, the State Department said, and stressed “the importance of a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation.”
",-1
"The talks were “direct and candid,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
",-1
"Pompeo reminded his hosts that despite the numerous bilateral issues the two governments share, determining Khashoggi’s fate was the urgent purpose of this trip, she said.
",-1
"Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the autocratic Saudi leadership, was last seen entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on Oct. 2, where he was seeking papers to marry his fiancée.
",-1
"A 15-member Saudi military team had entered the consulate with a bone saw shortly before Khashoggi arrived, and flew out of the country soon after, the reports said.
",-1
"Saudi officials insisted that Khashoggi left the consulate but have provided no video or other evidence.
",-1
"They have denied any responsibility for his disappearance.
",-1
"Hoping to stem a growing furor, Trump on Monday suggested “rogue killers,” not the Saudi royal family, may have carried out the murder.
",-1
"Critics quickly said that Trump was providing an excuse for the Saudi leaders, and participating in a cover-up.
",-1
"They floated the idea later Monday of claiming that Khashoggi, who wrote opinion pieces for the Washington Post and Arab media, was accidentally killed in an interrogation gone awry inside the consulate — supposedly without the approval of the king or crown prince.
",-1
"Publicly, Pompeo and his hosts looked calm and friendly when they met Tuesday in Riyadh.
",-1
"At one point, as they greeted each other, Prince Mohammed noted the two countries were important allies.
",-1
"“Absolutely,” Pompeo said, smiling.
",-1
"The United States long guaranteed Saudi security in exchange for a steady supply of oil.
",-1
"Those ties have frayed even as the Trump administration has embraced the Saudi rulers as a crucial regional ally in efforts to constrain Iran and to craft a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians.
",-1
"The current crisis has put those broader goals at risk, and the White House has scrambled to find a face-saving solution for the Saudi rulers.
",-1
"He has ruled out cancelling or suspending billions of dollars in arms deals with the oil-rich country.
",-1
"Many members of Congress have demanded the White House take tougher actions, including punitive sanctions on Saudi rulers.
",-1
"But Congress has taken no action on its own.

"Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case
",-1
"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo expressed confidence Wednesday that the Saudi government could be trusted to investigate the disappearance and suspected murder of a U.S.-based Saudi journalist in a Saudi diplomatic facility in Turkey — despite the likelihood that senior Saudi officials were involved.
",-1
"Speaking in Ankara, Turkey, Pompeo offered that support hours after President Donald Trump had mounted an even stronger defense for the Saudi rulers, saying, “Here we go again with you’re guilty until proven innocent.”
",-1
"The dissident journalist, who lived in Virginia, vanished Oct. 2 after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.
",-1
"Neither Trump nor his top diplomat offered any new facts or insights in the case.
",-1
"But unless authorities recover his body or other conclusive evidence of his death, the mystery may remain unsolved.
",-1
"Pompeo wrapped up two days of emergency talks in the region — first with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, and then with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara — and headed back to Washington on Wednesday.
",-1
"Turkish crime scene investigators and forensic specialists were allowed to search for evidence in the Saudi consulate and a nearby residence on Tuesday.
",-1
"Erdogan later complained that the interior walls had been repainted in recent days.
",-1
"On his flight from Riyadh to Ankara, Pompeo reiterated his confidence that the Saudi government would conduct a “thorough, complete, and transparent investigation,” adding that they will “show the entire world” the results.
",-1
"He said Saudi leaders made a commitment “to hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that, whether they are a senior officer or official.” He said they made “no exceptions,” including presumably members of the royal family.
",-1
"Asked if the Saudis had informed him whether Khashoggi was alive or dead, Pompeo said, “I don’t want to talk about any of the facts.
",-1
"They didn’t want to either, in that they want to have the opportunity to complete this investigation in a thorough way.”
",-1
"Asked if he believed the Saudi rulers’ repeated denial of complicity, Pompeo said he was reserving judgment.
",-1
"“I think that’s — I think that’s — I think that’s a reasonable thing to do, to give them that opportunity,” Pompeo said, “(and then) we’ll all get to evaluate the work that they do.”
",-1
"Pompeo refused to discuss possible consequences for those found responsible for Khashoggi’s disappearance, reiterating at least three times the “importance of the investigation.”
",-1
"Later Wednesday, Pompeo said during a refueling stopover in Brussels that Erdogan had informed him the Saudis were cooperating with the Turkish investigation “after a couple of delays.”
",-1
"Turkish officials “seemed pretty confident the Saudis will permit them to do things they need to do to complete” the investigation, Pompeo told reporters traveling with him.
",-1
"In a sign that the administration is looking to help Saudi Arabia get out of its dilemma, Pompeo urged Americans to be mindful of the extensive energy, economic and security ties between Riyadh and Washington, including efforts against what he called the world’s largest supporter of terrorism, Iran.
",-1
"“We need to make sure we are mindful of that as we approach decisions” on whether to impose sanctions or take other punitive steps against Riyadh, as many in Congress and elsewhere have urged.
",-1
"Critics questioned whether the Saudi rulers, who preside over an authoritarian regime that allows little opposition, can be relied on to conduct a credible probe into Khashoggi’s fate — especially without decisive pressure from their close ally, the Trump administration.
",-1
"Saudi leaders for two weeks denied knowing anything about the Khashoggi case.
",-1
"On Monday, they began floating a scenario — initially adopted by Trump — that blamed the murder inside the consulate on “rogue killers,” and then suggested the writer was accidentally killed during an interrogation that went awry.
",-1
"Analysts familiar with the desert kingdom said it was likely Saudi leaders were hoping the scandal would blow over and that they could wait it out.
",-1
"“We received commitments that they would complete this (investigation), and I am counting on them to do that,” Pompeo said.
",-1
"“They gave me their word.”
",-1
"Trump threatens military closure at US border to stop migrants
",-1
"Trump, who ran in 2016 promising to tighten U.S. immigration laws and stanch the inflow of undocumented migrants, has called for cutting off foreign aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador if they don’t stop the migrants.
",-1
"He claimed Thursday — without providing evidence — that Democrats are backing the human movement to bolster their case for “open borders and existing weak laws.”
",-1
"Days ago the president threatened to withhold American aid from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador if the flow of immigrants wasn’t stopped.
",-1
"This prompted the Honduran Foreign Ministry to urge its citizens not to join the group, according to Reuters.
",-1
"Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez said in a public address on Tuesday evening some Hondurans in the caravan had already returned home and the government was preparing to support them.
",-1
"He did not specify how many had turned back.
",-1
"Still, the caravan had grown to about 4,000 people today.
",-1
"NBC News reported that many of those in the caravan are unaccompanied children.
",-1
"Mexico is said to have deployed 500 additional federal police to its border with Guatemala in anticipation of the caravan’s arrival.

"In first public rebuke by the White House, Mnuchin pulls out of Saudi investment conference to protest Khashoggi case
",-1
"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Thursday he was pulling out of a major Saudi investment conference, known as Davos in the Desert, in the first public rebuke by the White House of the Saudi regime over the disappearance and suspected murder of a dissident Saudi journalist who lived in Virginia.
",-1
"Trade and finance ministers from Britain, France, Holland and other countries, the head of the International Monetary Fund, as well as CEOs of multiple major companies already had withdrawn in protest, and Mnuchin was under growing pressure to add his name to the list.
",-1
"Mnuchin tweeted the decision after meeting with President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo at the White House.
",-1
"Pompeo later told reporters that he had urged the president to give the Saudi government “a few more days” to explain what happened to Jamal Khashoggi, who vanished after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on Oct. 2.
",-1
"Khashoggi wrote opinion columns for the Washington Post critical of the Saudi royal family.
",-1
"Saudi King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler, have denied to both Trump and Pompeo any knowledge of the alleged murder or having ordered it.
",-1
"Pompeo returned Wednesday night from meetings with Saudi and Turkish leaders in Riyadh and Ankara and went to the White House Thursday morning to brief Trump, who has come under mounting pressure from Congress and rights groups to punish Saudi Arabia.
",-1
"Pompeo said the Saudis “understand the serious nature” of Khashoggi’s disappearance, and would conduct a thorough and “timely” investigation.
",-1
"Their findings, Pompeo said, “will be transparent for everyone to see, to ask questions about, to inquire with respect to its thoroughness.”
",-1
"He said he told the president “that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we too have a complete understanding of the facts” before making decisions on how the U.S. should respond.
",-1
"Turkey is conducting its own probe, and Pompeo said those results will also be taken into consideration.
",-1
"He again stressed the importance of Saudi Arabia as a strategic ally, in a relationship, he noted, that dates back more than 80 years.
",-1
"The administration’s reluctance to condemn the Saudi government has fueled criticism from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, from diplomats and from even some corporations that long have profited from close relations with the Saudi royal family.
",-1
"“We just are going to allow the process to move forward, allow the facts to unfold,” Pompeo said.

",-1
"As of now, the migrant caravan has grown in size to over 4,000 people.

"….In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught – and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!..

"Other Hondurans are leaving the country to join the caravan of illegal immigrants attempting to illegally enter the United States against president Trump’s wishes.
",-1
"Trump also threatened to stop all federal foreign aid payments to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador if the countries failed to block the flow of illegal immigrants and blamed Democrats for rejecting a reform of immigration laws allowing them to claim asylum.
",-1
"He also claimed that the caravan included criminals.

"Not only did Trump threaten to send the military to the border, but he also threatened to stop all federal payments to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador if they didn't block the caravan.

"The obvious question I have is: Why are you not stopping those payments now, Mr. President?

"Trump also seemed ready to back out on his new trade deal, which is hardly a deal for the US, with Mexico if they failed to stop the caravan.

"In fact, every single migrant who crosses over into our country will more than likely commit at least 28 crimes in order to present themselves as legal.

"Student organizers boot SNL writer from stage during standup routine for jokes deemed offensive
",-1
"Saturday Night Live writer and comedian Nimesh Patel was pulled from the stage by event organizers after telling jokes that were criticized as racist and homophobic during his performance at cultureSHOCK: Reclaim, an event held by Columbia Asian American Alliance on Friday night.
",-1
"Patel, 32, was the first Indian-American writer for SNL, and has since been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing.
",-1
"Patel has previously performed on Late Night with Seth Meyers and opened for comedians such as Chris Rock.
",-1
"During the event, Patel’s performance featured commentary on his experience living in a diverse area of New York City—including a joke about a gay, black man in his neighborhood—which AAA officials deemed inappropriate.
",-1
"About 30 minutes into Patel’s set, members of AAA interrupted the performance, denounced his jokes about racial identities and sexual orientation, and provided him with a few moments for closing remarks.
",-1
"Compared to his other jokes, ones specifically targeting sexual orientation audibly receive less laughter from the crowd.
",-1
"cultureSHOCK, an annual charity showcase featuring a fashion show, productions by various student groups and a famous performer, aims to provide a platform for Asian American artistic expression and breakthrough harmful stereotypes.

"Neither Patel and nor AAA could immediately be reached for comment.

"Adam Warren, CC ‘22, was in the audience Friday night.

"Warren said that AAA made the right decision to remove Patel from the stage due to the nature of his jokes, which contradicted the sensitive nature of the event itself.

"Kamala Harris & Elizabeth Warren Have Ethics Complaint Filed Against Them In Senate
",-1
"Senators Kamala Harris, who basically said that Judge Brett Kavanaugh was guilty because she believed Christine Blasey Ford's unsubstantiated and uncorroborated accusations against him, and Elizabeth Warren, also known as ""Fauxahontas,"" are the two members of the Senate who will be investigated.
",-1
"Both Harris and Warren stand accused of breaking fundraising rules by sending out fundraising emails asking for donations to support their votes against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.
",-1
"The Washington Times reports:
",-1
"A watchdog group filed a Senate ethics complaint Monday against Sens.
",-1
"Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren for sending out fundraising emails asking for donations to support their votes against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh — even before they cast their votes against him.
",-1
"While voting and then asking supporters to back that decision with cash is common, the watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), says asking for money ahead of time crosses the line into vote-buying.
",-1
"FACT asked the Senate ethics committee to probe fundraising emails sent by Ms. Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, and Ms. Harris, California Democrat.
",-1
"Ms. Warren’s email said she was demanding a delay on the judge’s confirmation vote and asked for donations for her 2018 election campaign, while Ms. Harris’s emails detailed several of her actions as a member of the Judiciary Committee, including her questioning of the president’s pick for the high court, and asking for contributions.
",-1
"Of course, but like most of these kinds of violations, the only thing that might actually occur here is censure, and that is highly unlikely in the current climate.
",-1
"However, voters should be aware of the unethical practice of both of these senators.
",-1
"While Harris is not up for re-election this year, Warren is.
",-1
"Retailing these poisonous lies ought to hurt her chances for election to Congress, especially after the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre.

"On November 16, 2012, Somali-born Minnesota state Rep. Ilhan Omar (D), who’s currently running for the state’s 5th Congressional District seat, sent out the following tweet:
",-1
"#Gaza #Palestine #Israel
",-1
"In May of this year, Twitter user John Gilmore dug up the six-year-old tweet, forcing Omar to defend herself.
",-1
"She responded: “Drawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating Jews.
",-1
"You are a hateful sad man, I pray to Allah you get the help you need and find happiness.”
",-1
"Omar’s initial tweet came three days after “Palestinian terrorists in Gaza launched more than 150 rockets at Israel” from November 10-13, 2012, reports the Jewish Virtual Library.
",-1
"On November 14, the Israeli Air Force killed Ahmad Jabari in an air strike.
",-1
"Jabari, the military commander of Hamas, was allegedly responsible for, or instrumental in, multiples terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and military personnel since the 1990s.
",-1
"On November 15, another terrorist-launched rocket killed three Israeli civilians.
",-1
"This and other rocket launches from Palestinian militants in Gaza prompted Israel to initiate Operation Pillar of Defense.
",-1
"According to Israel’s official New York consulate website, during the operation, “the IDF targeted over 1,500 terror sites including 19 senior command centers, operational control centers and Hamas’ senior-rank headquarters, 30 senior operatives, damaging Hamas’ command and control, hundreds of underground rocket launchers, 140 smuggling tunnels, 66 terror tunnels, dozens of Hamas operation rooms and bases, 26 weapon manufacturing and storage facilities and dozens of long-range rocket launchers and launch sites.”
",-1
"Omar defended herself against charges of anti-Semitism in a July interview with ABC News, saying: “These accusations are without merit.
",-1
"The oft-repeated notion that Israel is an “apartheid” nation is incorrect on multiple grounds.

"Perhaps the most succinct refutation of this idea comes from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which writes:

",-1
"I don’t care if you go and do that, go ahead.”

"Probably she thinks that if she disavows these words now, she will be thought of as “Islamophobic” by a significant portion of her base.
",-1
"There is more.
",-1
"Fox News also reported that Sinema “promoted events at Arizona State University featuring a lawyer convicted for aiding an Islamist terror organization and its leader.
",-1
"Sinema, a co-founder of the activist group Local to Global Justice, invited people in a now-closed Yahoo group to attend two events with Lynn Stewart, both in 2003.
",-1
"At the time of the invite, Stewart had been charged with helping her former client Omar Abdel Rahman, a radical Egyptian spiritual leader of a terror group, to pass on secret messages to his followers to commit terror attacks.”

"For me, U.S. aid should be leverage.

"I’m only 42 years old but my teachers were of that generation that marched with Martin Luther King.

"A Palestinian state would be a new base for renewed jihad attacks against Israel.
",-1
"But a “one-state solution” would be even worse, unless that state is the current State of Israel, but that is not the one state Tlaib has in mind.
",-1
"She is calling for an Israeli/Palestinian state that would not be a Jewish State or a homeland for the Jewish people, but a federation in which Palestinians would soon overwhelm Jews demographically.
",-1
"Progressive denial of their rights would soon follow: as I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS, there has never been a majority Muslim nation in which Jews enjoyed equality of rights with Muslims.

"The motivation for the marriage remains unclear.
",-1
"However, the totality of the evidence points to possible immigration fraud and student loan fraud.” What’s more, she swore to apparent falsehoods in court.
",-1
"But Leftists rarely have to answer for their corruption, and in a Democrat House, Omar will much more likely be celebrated than investigated.

"The problem with this latest fabrication is that Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry.

"This is impossible.

"The visitor logs were not kept by Wikileaks, but by the very strict Ecuadorean security.
",-1
"Nobody was ever admitted without being entered in the logs.
",-1
"The procedure was very thorough.

"I feature in the logs every time I visited.

"There were no exceptions.
",-1
"What possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort?
",-1
"Previously Harding and the Guardian have published documents faked by the Moreno government regarding a diplomatic appointment to Russia for Assange of which he had no knowledge.
",-1
"Now they follow this up with more documents aimed to provide fictitious evidence to bolster Mueller’s pathetically failed attempt to substantiate the story that Russia deprived Hillary of the Presidency.
",-1
"I would love to believe that the fact Julian has never met Manafort is bound to be established.
",-1
"Assange never met Manafort.
",-1
"The DNC emails were downloaded by an insider.

"Assange never even considered fleeing to Russia.
",-1
"Those are the facts, and I am in a position to give you a personal assurance of them.
",-1
"I am not a fan of Donald Trump.
",-1
"Plainly the government of Ecuador is releasing lies about Assange to curry favour with the security establishment of the USA and UK, and to damage Assange’s support prior to expelling him from the Embassy.
",-1
"He will then be extradited from London to the USA on charges of espionage.
",-1
"That supposedly great newspaper titles like the Guardian, New York Times and Washington Post are involved in the spreading of lies to damage Assange, and are seeking his imprisonment for publishing state secrets, is clear evidence that the idea of the “liberal media” no longer exists in the new plutocratic age.

"At one point the caravan was anywhere between 7,000 to 10,000 members strong and mostly consists of migrants with ineligible asylum claims, which include job-seekers, previously deported illegal aliens, and Central Americans looking to get away from crime.

"(Tallahassee) Project Veritas Action Fund has released undercover video from Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum’s campaign, revealing his election strategy includes making empty promises to voters.
",-1
"This is the seventh undercover video report Project Veritas has released in a series revealing secrets and lies from political campaigns in 2018.
",-1
"Said James O’Keefe, founder and president of Project Veritas Action:
",-1
"Featured in this report is a campaign staffer who works on Andrew Gillum’s gubernatorial campaign.
",-1
"SMITH: “That’s not for them to know… That’s not for them to know.
",-1
"Remember our saying, modern day fairy tales start with ‘once I am elected.
",-1
"SMITH: “So, let’s go back to Mr. Gillum’s platform, right?
",-1
"Raise the corporate tax in Florida from 7 to 11 percent.
",-1
"Medicare for all, that will never happen.
",-1
"The reason being, the legislature that write the bills is all Republican controlled.
",-1
"Democratic governor, Republican legislature.
",-1
"So, unless the legislature writes a bill, and it got voted on the floor, it cannot pass.”
",-1
"You have to whip them up into a frenzy in order for them to vote.
",-1
"Once Gillum is in, in another 2 years, other Republican Senators and Legislators will be on the ballot.
",-1
"Smith also explains that the Gillum campaign can’t let voters know what Gillum’s true agenda is before election day:
",-1
"SMITH: “… We don’t, do we have to let [the voters] know what the agenda is ahead of time?
",-1
"We can’t… We cannot… You alienate everybody.
",-1
"Then you get painted like, oh, Gillum is being painted, no.
",-1
"Dale Holeness, who is the Broward County Commissioner and also works on Gillum’s campaign, explains Gillum’s gun control views:
",-1
"HOLENESS: “There ought to be at least a three-day waiting period for everybody and a full background check for everybody… And we need to- And these automatic guns with sixteen rounds a minute, they ought to not be on the streets either, so that’s his plan.”
",-1
"Adrian Young, who works for the Florida Democratic Party also elaborates on Gillum’s gun control views in the report:
",-1
"YOUNG: “… I do think he’s not saying specifically like I’m going to ban bump stocks or I’m against ATs, only because he’s running a race right now.

"Omar Smith, a Gillum campaign staffer who went to college with the candidate, says on video that if Gillum is elected, none of the things outlined in his platform would happen.
",-1
"He says that “that’s not for [voters] to know.”

"“Remember our saying, modern-day fairy tales start with ‘once I am elected,'” Smith says.

"GILLUM ELECTION STRATEGY: ""You whip 'em up.

"Alright?
",-1
"He points to specific campaign promises Gillum has made, including raising the corporate tax in Florida, raising teacher pay, and Medicare for All, admitting they are lies.
",-1
"So, let’s go back to Mr. Gillum’s platform, right?
",-1
"Raise teachers’ pay to $50,000; that will never happen.
",-1
"Medicare for all; that will never happen.

"The reason being, the legislature that write the bills is all Republican-controlled.
",-1
"So, unless the legislature writes a bill, and it got voted on the floor, it cannot pass.
",-1
"The full video shows Smith saying that the strategy to change the Florida legislature is to take “poor” and “middle income” people and “whip them up into a frenzy in order for them to vote.”
",-1
"Smith defines Gillum’s political beliefs as “part of the crazy crazy crazies” on the progressive Left.
",-1
"More damaging footage includes Democratic operatives explaining Gillum’s positions on gun control and indicating he would support banning AR-15 rifles.
",-1
"Florida Democrat Party community engagement specialist Adrian Young also admits on video that Gillum is not campaigning with that position because it would be unpopular with Florida voters.
",-1
"“I do think he’s not saying specifically like I’m going to ban bump stocks or I’m against ARs, only because he’s running a race right now.
",-1
"I do think he would support anybody doing that stuff, Bill Nelson.

"“What we found in the Gillum campaign was just what we found in Missouri, Tennessee and Arizona, a candidate lying to the voters he needs to win the election,” said Project Veritas Action President James O’Keefe.

"Broward County Election Supervisor Brenda Snipes Resigns Amid Florida Voter Fraud
",-1
"However, that should not be good enough for the people of Broward County nor the state of Florida.
",-1
"Charges must be made and her arrest should be imminent.
",-1
"The Sun-Sentinel reports:
",-1
"“It is true.
",-1
"She did send it,” said Burnadette Norris-Weeks, an attorney who works as counsel to the Supervisor of Elections Office.
",-1
"Evelyn Perez-Verdia, a former office spokeswoman who left several years ago, said Sunday evening she was told by people in the office that the letter was sent “to Tallahassee” earlier in the day.
",-1
"Norris-Weeks said she saw an early draft of the letter.
",-1
"In the version she saw, she said Snipes, 75, expressed a desire to spend more time with her family.
",-1
"In the final version of the resignation letter, sent to Gov.
",-1
"“I am ready to pass the torch,” she wrote in the letter, which made no mention of controversies surrounding the 2018 election.
",-1
"“Although I have enjoyed this work tremendously over these many election cycles, both large and small, I am ready to pass the torch,” she wrote.
",-1
"Snipes allowed illegal aliens, non-citizens and felons to vote.
",-1
"According to Breitbart, she illegally destroyed ballots.
",-1
"Broward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes’ office has admitted “they don’t know” how many ballots there are still to count.
",-1
"Snipes’ latest failure to finalize Tuesday’s election returns days after the polls closed is also in violation of Florida law, which requires elections officials to “report all early voting and all tabulated vote-by-mail results to the Department of State within 30 minutes after the polls close.
",-1
"Thereafter, the canvassing board shall report, with the exception of provisional ballot results, updated precinct election results to the department at least every 45 minutes until all results are completely reported.”
",-1
"The irony that a constitutionally ineligible candidate for the presidency and RINO extraordinaire, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), pointed out that voter fraud going on in Florida just a day after the elections probably didn't help the pressure that Snipes was facing.
",-1
"Dems got voters to use altered forms to fix & submit as many mail ballots as possible after FL deadline in hopes that a judge would later order state to count them.

"A day after Florida’s election left top state races too close to call, a Democratic party leader directed staffers and volunteers to share altered election forms with voters to fix signature problems on absentee ballots after the state’s deadline.
",-1
"The altered forms surfaced in Broward, Santa Rosa, Citrus and Okaloosa counties and were reported to federal prosecutors to review for possible election fraud as Florida counties completed a required recount in three top races.
",-1
"But an email obtained by the USA TODAY NETWORK – Florida shows that Florida Democrats were organizing a broader statewide effort beyond those counties to give voters the altered forms to fix improper absentee ballots after the Nov. 5 deadline.

"Prosecutors Called in After FL Democrats Caught Altering Election Documents.
",-1
"By Karista Baldwin, Conservative Tribune November 15, 2018:
",-1
"Last week, the Florida Department of State asked federal prosecutors to look into alterations made on official election documents from the 2018 midterms.
",-1
"Politico reported that the department points to the Florida Democratic Party for changing dates on forms used to amend absentee and mail-in ballots.
",-1
"These ballots would have been flagged for missing information or for being filled out with incorrect information.
",-1
"The amending forms, called “cure affidavits,” were due at 5 p.m on Nov. 5, the evening before Election Day, at the latest.
",-1
"During pre-Election Day absentee and mail-in voting, political parties have access to lists of people whose mail-in ballots were rejected for errors.
",-1
"Meanwhile, cure affidavits are publicly available and anyone can send them to voters to prompt them to “fix” their ballots.
",-1
"According to Politico, the DOS released affidavits on Tuesday, which demonstrate that four different counties said the ballots could be returned by 5 p.m on Thursday, Nov. 8, past the official due date.
",-1
"Among the counties involved with the altered affidavits is Broward, which has been a hotspot for controversy as many Florida races have led to a recount.
",-1
"Do you agree with the call for a federal investigation?
",-1
"Yes No
",-1
"Completing this poll entitles you to Conservative Tribune news updates free of charge.
",-1
"You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
",-1
"Politico reported that they received audio of a Florida Democratic party volunteer leaving a voicemail to a voter in Palm Beach County to revise their mailed ballot after Election Day.
",-1
"Palm Beach County failed to make Florida’s recount deadline on Thursday.
",-1
"Matt Dixon, bureau chief of Politico, tweeted on Wednesday that the Democratic party volunteer call came during Florida’s ballot recount after ballots were allowed to be amended.
",-1
"“We are now doing a recount, so we want to make sure you let your vote be counted,” Dixon quoted from the voicemail.
",-1
"It seems that Democrats may have called absentee voters about supplying them with cure affidavits after the permitted date.
",-1
"It also looks like whoever sent out the cure affidavits physically changed the due date to say Nov. 8, instead of Nov. 6.
",-1
"Bradley McVay, DOS interim general counsel, asked attorneys in Florida to investigate the conflicting dates.
",-1
"“Altering a form in a manner that provides the incorrect date for a voter to cure a defect … imposes a burden on the voter significant enough to frustrate the voter’s ability to vote,” McVay wrote in a letter, sent on Nov. 9 and publicly released on Tuesday.
",-1
"According to DOS officials, they are less concerned with the inaccurate dates, and more concerned with the fact that the cure affidavits appear to have been deliberately altered.
",-1

"Of the many allegations of ballot mishandling in Florida, this is the first that has been referred to the federal government.

"While Democrats seem to have told voters they could fix ballot errors up to the Thursday after Election Day — these votes could not count.

"It looks like Democrats may have hurt their own interests by misleading their voters.

"“Top FL County Election Official Illegally Let People Vote Over Fax, Email,” by Randy DeSoto, Western Journal, November 13, 2018 (thanks to Mark):

",-1
"Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and others are expressing outrage at the special provision made for these voters.

"The Miami Herald reported that Bay County Supervisor of Elections Mark Andersen said on Monday that 11 ballots were accepted by email and 147 were faxed in, though Florida law only permits those serving in the military overseas to use these methods….

"According to the Herald, Gov.

"Altered Election Documents Tied To Florida Democrats Reviewed By Federal Prosecutors
",-1
"“Federal prosecutors reviewing altered election documents tied to Florida Democrats,” by Matt Dixon, Politico, November 14, 2018:
",-1
"TALLAHASSEE — The Florida Department of State last week asked federal prosecutors to investigate dates that were changed on official state election documents, the first voting “irregularities” it has flagged in the wake of the 2018 elections.
",-1
"The concerns, which the department says can be tied to the Florida Democratic Party, center around date changes on forms used to fix vote-by-mail ballots sent with incorrect or missing information.
",-1
"Known as “cure affidavits,” those documents used to fix mail ballots were due no later than 5 p.m. on Nov. 5 — the day before the election.
",-1
"But affidavits released on Tuesday by the DOS show that documents from four different counties said the ballots could be returned by 5 p.m. on Thursday, which is not accurate.
",-1
"Audio of a Florida Democratic Party caller leaving a voicemail message asking a Palm Beach County voter to fix their vote by mail ballot after Election Day, which is not allowed, was also sent to POLITICO separately.
",-1
"It was not part of the information turned over to federal prosecutors.
",-1
"Among the counties in question is Broward, which emerged as the epicenter of controversy as three statewide races and three local legislative races went into recounts following the Nov. 6 elections.
",-1
"DOS officials have repeatedly told the media that the monitors they sent to Broward County saw no election fraud.
",-1
"It wasn’t until Tuesday that the office revealed publicly that it had turned over information to federal prosecutors.
",-1
"The information was sent on Nov. 9 by Bradley McVay, DOS’ interim general counsel, who asked that the altered dates be investigated.
",-1
"“Altering a form in a manner that provides the incorrect date for a voter to cure a defect … imposes a burden on the voter significant enough to frustrate the voter’s ability to vote,” McVay wrote in a letter that was sent Nov. 9 and released publicly on Tuesday.
",-1
"The letter was sent to U.S.
",-1
"Attorneys Christopher P. Canova of the Northern District of Florida, Maria Chapa Lopez of the Middle District of Florida and Ariana Fajardo Orshan in the Southern District of Florida.
",-1
"The records released by DOS, which is part of Gov.
",-1
"Political parties can get daily lists of people who had their mail-in ballots rejected.
",-1
"Political parties — or anyone else — can also get the publicly available cure affidavits and send them to voters who had a mail-in ballot rejected to encourage them to fix the ballots.
",-1
"In an email chain released as part of the Department of State’s Tuesday document dump, Citrus County Supervisor of Elections Susan Gill last week told DOS officials that a voter who received one of the cure affidavits with the wrong date had also received a call from a number identified as the Tallahassee office of the Florida Democratic Party, an indication the party was reaching out about her vote by mail ballot.
",-1
"“When I called it, it is the Democratic Party of Florida,” she said in a Nov. 8 email to DOS officials.
",-1
"She went on to write that she thinks the incorrect date was used because whoever sent the cure affidavit mixed up the deadline for cure affidavits with the deadline for provisional ballots.

"So far, we are being told that authorities are keeping an eye on the migrants as they celebrate their journey, but no reports have been issued saying they have actually crossed over yet.
",-1
"Faced with the backlash, the Guardian quickly – and very quietly – rowed back its initial certainty that its story was based on verified facts.
",-1
"Instead, it amended the text, without acknowledging it had done so, to attribute the claims to unnamed, and uncheckable, “sources”.
",-1
"It is intended to provide evidence for long-standing allegations that Assange conspired with Trump, and Trump’s supposed backers in the Kremlin, to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race.
",-1
"The Guardian’s latest story provides a supposedly stronger foundation for an existing narrative: that Assange and Wikileaks knowingly published emails hacked by Russia from the Democratic party’s servers.
",-1
"In truth, there is no public evidence that the emails were hacked, or that Russia was involved.
",-1
"Central actors have suggested instead that the emails were leaked from within the Democratic party.
",-1
"These show that party bureaucrats sought to rig the primaries to make sure Clinton’s challenger for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, lost.
",-1
"Manafort has denied the Guardian’s claims, while Assange has threatened to sue the Guardian for libel.
",-1
"‘Responsible for Trump’
",-1
"The emotional impact of the Guardian story is to suggest that Assange is responsible for four years or more of Trump rule.
",-1
"The intention is to deeply discredit Assange, and by extension the Wikileaks organisation, in the eyes of right-thinking liberals.
",-1
"That, in turn, will make it much easier to silence Assange and the vital cause he represents: the use of new media to hold to account the old, corporate media and political elites through the imposition of far greater transparency.
",-1
"The Guardian story will prepare public opinion for the moment when Ecuador’s rightwing government under President Lenin Moreno forces Assange out of the embassy, having already withdrawn most of his rights to use digital media.
",-1
"It will soften opposition when the UK moves to arrest Assange on self-serving bail violation charges and extradites him to the US.
",-1
"And it will pave the way for the US legal system to lock Assange up for a very long time.
",-1
"See here and here.
",-1
"Now Assange and his supporters have been proved right once again.
",-1
"An administrative error this month revealed that the US justice department had secretly filed criminal charges against Assange.
",-1
"Heavy surveillance
",-1
"Glenn Greenwald is far from alone in noting that London is possibly the most surveilled city in the world, with CCTV cameras everywhere.
",-1
"The environs of the Ecuadorian embassy are monitored especially heavily, with continuous filming by the UK and Ecuadorian authorities and most likely by the US and other actors with an interest in Assange’s fate.
",-1
"According to Greenwald: “If Paul Manafort … visited Assange at the Embassy, there would be ample amounts of video and other photographic proof demonstrating that this happened.
",-1
"The Guardian provides none of that.”
",-1
"Former British ambassador Craig Murray also points out the extensive security checks insisted on by the embassy to which any visitor to Assange must submit.
",-1
"Any visits by Manafort would have been logged.
",-1
"In fact, the Guardian obtained the embassy’s logs in May, and has never made any mention of either Manafort or “Russians” being identified in them.
",-1
"It did not refer to the logs in its latest story.
",-1
"Murray:
",-1
"No fact-checking
",-1
"It is worth noting it should be vitally important for a serious publication like the Guardian to ensure its claims are unassailably true – both because Assange’s personal fate rests on their veracity, and because, even more importantly, a fundamental right, the freedom of the press, is at stake.
",-1
"Given this, one would have expected the Guardian’s editors to have insisted on the most stringent checks imaginable before going to press with Harding’s story.
",-1
"At a very minimum, they should have sought out a response from Assange and Manafort before publication.
",-1
"Neither precaution was taken.
",-1
"I worked for the Guardian for a number of years, and know well the layers of checks that any highly sensitive story has to go through before publication.
",-1
"In that lengthy process, a variety of commissioning editors, lawyers, backbench editors and the editor herself, Kath Viner, would normally insist on cuts to anything that could not be rigorously defended and corroborated.
",-1
"That at the very least hints that the Guardian thought they had “insurance” on this story.
",-1
"And the only people who could have promised that kind of insurance are the security and intelligence services – presumably of Britain, the United States and / or Ecuador.
",-1
"It appears the Guardian has simply taken this story, provided by spooks, at face value.
",-1
"Even if it later turns out that Manafort did visit Assange, the Guardian clearly had no compelling evidence for its claims when it published them.
",-1
"That is profoundly irresponsible journalism – fake news – that should be of the gravest concern to readers.
",-1
"A pattern, not an aberration
",-1
"I think the Guardian is an important paper with great journalists.
",-1
"I hope the story turns out true.

"If Manafort went there, there's video.
",-1
"Let's see it.
",-1
"— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) November 28, 2018
",-1
"Deeper malaise
",-1
"What this misses is that the Guardian’s attacks on Assange are not exceptional or motivated solely by personal animosity.
",-1
"They are entirely predictable and systematic.
",-1
"Even aside from its decade-long campaign against Assange, the Guardian is far from “solid and reliable”, as Greenwald claims.
",-1
"Over the past three years, the Guardian has injected credibility into the Israel lobby’s desperate efforts to tar Corbyn as an anti-semite.
",-1
"See here, here and here.
",-1
"Heroes of the neoliberal order
",-1
"Its pages, however, are readily available to the latest effort to prop up the status quo from Tony Blair, the man who led Britain, on false pretences, into the largest crime against humanity in living memory – the attack on Iraq.
",-1
"The Guardian also has an especial soft spot for blogger Elliot Higgins, who, aided by the Guardian, has shot to unlikely prominence as a self-styled “weapons expert”.
",-1
"Like Luke Harding, Higgins invariably seems ready to echo whatever the British and American security services need verifying “independently”.
",-1
"The truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange, or in its much longer-running campaign to vilify him.
",-1
"With this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake – it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative.
",-1
"The Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence.

",-1
"In 2015 the British Guardian appointed Katherine Viner as editor in chief.
",-1
"Under her lead the paper took a new direction.
",-1
"While it earlier made attempts to balance its shoddier side with some interesting reporting, it is now solidly main stream in the worst sense.
",-1
"On November 27 the Guardian prepared to publish a story which asserted that Paula Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, had met Julian Assange, the publisher of Wikileaks, in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on at least three occasions.
",-1
"Some two hours before the story went public it contacted Manafort and Assange's lawyers to get their comments.
",-1
"Assange's Wikileaks responded through its public Twitter account which has 5.4 million followers.
",-1
"On of those followers is Katherine Viner:
",-1
"It attached the email the Guardian's Luke Harding had send.
",-1
"90 minutes later the Guardian piece went life.
",-1
"It led the front page and also appeared in print.
",-1
"The first version read:
",-1
"Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret talks with Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and visited around the time he joined Trump’s campaign, the Guardian has been told.
",-1
"Sources have said Manafort went to see Assange in 2013, 2015 and in spring 2016 – during the period when he was made a key figure in Trump’s push for the White House.
",-1
"It is unclear why Manafort wanted to see Assange and what was discussed.
",-1
"But the last meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
",-1
"A well-placed source has told the Guardian that Manafort went to see Assange around March 2016.
",-1
"Months later WikiLeaks released a stash of Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers.
",-1
"His lawyers declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the visits.
",-1
"The piece did not include the public denial Wikileaks issued to its 5.4 million followers one and a half hour before it was published.
",-1
"The Guardian piece came at a critical moment.
",-1
"Currently the U.K. and Ecuador conspire to deliver Julian Assange to U.S. authorities.
",-1
"On Monday special counsel Robert Mueller said Manafort lied to investigators, violating his recent plea deal.
",-1
"They distributed is as a factual account.
",-1
"It is likely that millions of people took note of its claim.
",-1
"Glenn Greenwald noted that the Ecuadorian embassy is under heavy CCTV surveillance.
",-1
"There are several guards, and visitors have to provide their identity to enter it.
",-1
"Every visit is logged.
",-1
"If Manafort had really visited Assange, it would have long been known:
",-1
"A year ago an important Moon of Alabama piece - From Snowden To Russia-gate - The CIA And The Media - mentioned Harding:
",-1
"Take for example Luke Harding of the Guardian who just published a book titled Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win.
",-1
"He was taken apart in a Real News interview (vid) about the book.
",-1
"When asked for any proof for his assertion Harding defensively says that he is just ""storytelling"" - in other words: it is fiction.
",-1
"Harding earlier wrote a book about Edward Snowden which was a similar sham.
",-1
"When he worked in Moscow he copied stories and passages from the now defunct Exile, run by Matt Taibbi and Mark Ames.
",-1
"The Guardian had to publish an apology.
",-1
"The new Guardian story looked like another weak attempt to connect the alleged Russian malfeasance with Assange and the Wikileaks publishing of the DNC emails.
",-1
"Assange and other involved people deny that such a relation existed.
",-1
"There is no public evidence that support such claims.
",-1
"Shortly after the Guardian's fake news story went public Paul Manafort issued an unequivocal denial:
",-1
"“I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him,” the statement said.
",-1
"“I have never been contacted by anyone connected to Wikileaks, either directly or indirectly.
",-1
"We are considering all legal options against the Guardian who proceeded with this story even after being notified by my representatives that it was false.”
",-1
"At 16:05 utc the Guardian silently edited the story.
",-1
"Caveats (here in italic and underlined) were added to the headline and within several paragraphs.
",-1
"No editorial note was attached to inform the readers of the changes:
",-1
"Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy, sources say ...
",-1
"It is unclear why Manafort would have wanted to see Assange and what was discussed.
",-1
"But the last apparent meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
",-1
"...
",-1
"Why Manafort might have sought out Assange in 2013 is unclear.
",-1
"His lawyers initially declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the visits.
",-1
"One paragraph was added to included Wikileaks' denial:
",-1
"In a series of tweets WikiLeaks said Assange and Manafort had not met.
",-1
"At 16:30 utc, under fire from other media and journalists, the Guardian issued a statement:
",-1
"This story relied on a number of sources.
",-1
"We put these allegations to both Paul Manafort and Julian Assange's representatives prior to publication.
",-1
"Neither responded to deny the visits taking place.
",-1
"We have since updated the story to reflect their denials.
",-1
"This defensive Guardian claim is, like its story, evidently completely false.
",-1
"Wikileaks publicly denied the Guardian's claims 90 minutes before the story was first published.
",-1
"Manafort asserts that his lawyers had notified the Guardian that the story was false before the Guardian 'proceeded with the story'.
",-1
"At 21:05 utc a third version was published which included Manafort's denial.
",-1
"Half an hour later Julian Assange instructed his lawyers to sue the Guardian for libel.
",-1
"Wikileaks opened a fund to support the lawsuit.
",-1
"The story was completely false and the Guardian knew it was.
",-1
"It disregarded and left out the denials the subjects of the story had issued before it was published.
",-1
"The Guardian has become a main outlet for British government disinformation operations aimed at defaming Russia.
",-1
"It smeared Assange and Snowden as Russian collaborators.
",-1
"It uncritically peddled the Russiagate story and the nonsensical Skripal claims which are both obviously concocted by British intelligence services.
",-1
"That seems to have become its main purpose.
",-1
"As Disobediant Media notes (emphasis in the original):
",-1
"It is no accident that Luke Harding is still employed: in fact, it is because of Harding’s consistent loyalty to establishment, specifically the UK intelligence apparatus, over the truth that determines his “success” amongst legacy press outlets.
",-1
"Harding is not a defacement or a departure from the norm, but the personification of it.
",-1
"Jonathan Cook, a former Guardian writer, makes a similar point:
",-1
"Its job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing, neoliberal order: ...
",-1
"It is openly publishing Goebbels' cartoons and rhetoric against Europes biggest state.
",-1
"There is no longer any line that it does not dare to cross.
",-1
"Unfortunately other 'western' media are not much better.
",-1
"Within hours of being published the Guardian piece was debunked as fake news.
",-1
"Harding is likely a major target for anyone wrapped up in Russia’s intelligence operation against the West’s democratic institutions.
",-1
"If this latest story about Manafort and Assange is false—that is, if, for example, the sources lied to Harding and Collyns (or if the sources themselves were lied to and thus thought they were being truthful in their statements to the journalists), or if the Ecuadorian intelligence document is a fake, the most logical explanation is that it is an attempt to make Harding look bad.
",-1
"The is zero evidence in the Politico screed that supports its suggestions and claims.
",-1
"It also included the false claim that Glenn Greenwald worked with Wikileaks on the Snowden papers.
",-1
"That claim was later removed.
",-1
"We have seen a similar pattern in the Skripal affair.
",-1
"When 'western' intelligence get caught in spreading disinformation, they accuse Russia of being the source of the fake.
